    <h1>Object Constraints / Blender</h1>

    <p>
    This page contains the information about Blender's object <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/constraints/index.html" target="_blank">constraints</a> which can be used with Verge3D.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:Constraints_and_Settings]

    <h2>Constraints and Settings</h2>

    <p>
    Below are are listed Blender object constraints that can be used with Verge3D. The parameters supported by Verge3D are overlaid with green color.
    </p>


    [anchor:Copy_Location]

    <h3>Copy Location</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to have the same location as its target.
    </p>

    [anchor:Copy_Rotation]

    <h3>Copy Rotation</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to match the rotation of its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/copy-rotation.jpg" alt="Blender Copy Rotation constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Copy_Scale]

    <h3>Copy Scale</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to match the scale of its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/copy-scale.jpg" alt="Blender Copy Scale constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Copy_Transforms]

    <h3>Copy Transforms</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to have the same transforms as its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/copy-transforms.jpg" alt="Blender Copy Transforms constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Limit_Distance]

    <h3>Limit Distance</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint forces its owner to stay either further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/limit-distance.jpg" alt="Blender Limit Distance constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Limit_Location]

    <h3>Limit Location</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint restricts the amount of allowed translations along each axis, through lower and upper bounds.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/limit-location.jpg" alt="Blender Limit Location constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Limit_Rotation]

    <h3>Limit Rotation</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, through lower and upper bounds.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/limit-rotation.jpg" alt="Blender Limit Rotation constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Limit_Scale]

    <h3>Limit Scale</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint restricts the amount of allowed scalings along each axis, through lower and upper bounds.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/limit-scale.jpg" alt="Blender Limit Scale constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Transformation]

    <h3>Transformation</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint allows to connect one type of transform property (location, rotation, or scale) of the target object to the same or a different type of transform property in the owner object.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/transformation.jpg" alt="Blender Transformation constraint" style="max-width: 519px">



    [anchor:Damped_Track]

    <h3>Damped Track</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint constrains one local axis of the owner to always point towards Target. This constraint uses a pure Swing rotation, i.e. the shortest possible single axis rotation. In other 3D software you can find it with the name “Look at” constraint.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/damped-track.jpg" alt="Blender Damped Track constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Track_To]

    <h3>Track To</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it always points a given *To* axis towards its target, with another *Up* axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis as possible. Thus you can implement billboarding with this constraint.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/track-to.jpg" alt="Blender Track To constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Locked_Track]

    <h3>Locked Track</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint works similar to *Track To* constraint, but with a locked axis.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/locked-track.jpg" alt="Blender Locked Track constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Child_Of]

    <h3>Child Of</h3>

    <p>
    This is the constraint version of the standard parent/children relationship between objects.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/child-of.jpg" alt="Blender Child Of constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Floor]

    <h3>Floor</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint allows you to use its target as a plane where the owner cannot go.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/floor.jpg" alt="Blender Floor constraint" style="max-width: 383px">



    [anchor:Follow_Path]

    <h3>Follow Path</h3>

    <p>
    This constraint allows you to move an object along the curve.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-blender/follow-path.jpg" alt="Blender Follow Path constraint" style="max-width: 700px">

    <p class="note">*Animate Path* button is not supported, instead <a href="manual/en/blender/Animation.html#Path_Animation">directly animate curve by keyframes</a>.</p>



    [anchor:Use_with_Puzzles]

    <h2>Use with Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
    All constraints, once assigned in Blender and exported, can be removed, muted or ummuted with a <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#remove_mute_unmute_constraint">puzzle</a>. Unlike in Blender, a removed/muted constraint does not reset the object - this puzzle just leaves the object with the same transform it had just before removing or muting.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, *Limit/Copy* *Location/Rotation/Scale* constraints can be assigned at runtime with <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#limit_transform">puzzles</a>.
    </p>
