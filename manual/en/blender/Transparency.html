    <h1>Transparency / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      Here we show how to enable transparency for Eevee/Cycles and glTF-compliant materials in Blender.

    <h2>Setting Up in Blender</h2>

    <p>
      Transparency for Eevee materials can be enabled by using a combination of the *Transparent BSDF* and the *Mix Shader* nodes. The factor in the *Mix Shader* node can be used to define the alpha value — you can directly specify a value or create a dependency from some other nodes such as *Fresnel* for more realistic look.
    </p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can use *Alpha* input of the Principled BSDF node.</p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/principled-bsdf-alpha.webp" alt="Alpha input of Principled BSDF node">

    <p>Use the *Blend Mode* dropdown to choose between transparency modes:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Auto</dt>
      <dd>Look into material to resolve possible transparency method: *Opaque* or *Alpha Blend*.</dd>
      <dt>Opaque</dt>
      <dd>Render material with no transparency.</dd>
      <dt>Alpha Clip</dt>
      <dd>Masked transparency (see <a href="manual/en/blender/Transparency.html#blended_vs_masked">below</a>).</dd>
      <dt>Alpha Hashed</dt>
      <dd>Hashed transparency, aka alpha to coverage. This method takes an intermediate position between masked and blended transparency. It uses MSAA rendering to improve the quality of alpha clipping.</dd>
      <dt>Alpha Blend</dt>
      <dd>Blended transparency (see <a href="manual/en/blender/Transparency.html#blended_vs_masked">below</a>).</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      To tweak your the material's transparency there are other options available on the *Verge3D Settings* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/material-settings.webp" alt="Blender transparency settings" style="max-width: 328px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Clip Threshold</dt>
      <dd>Threshold for alpha clipped (masked) materials. For pixels with alpha below the clip threshold, the surface will be culled and won't be rendered.</dd>
      <dt>Transparency Hack</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable one of the two non-standard rendering methods to eliminate transparency artifacts:
        <dl>
          <dt>Nearest Layer</dt>
          <dd>Render only the closest-to-the-camera transparency layer by using a separate depth buffer for culling (aka "depth prepass").</dd>
          <dt>Two-Pass</dt>
          <dd>Render back-face surfaces first followed by front-face surfaces. This method works only for double-sided materials, i.e. the *Render Side* property should be set to *Double-sided*.</dd>
        </dl>
        Both transparency hacks reduce performance, so use them only when it's really necessary.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    [anchor:blended_vs_masked]

    <h2>Blended vs Masked</h2>

    <p>
      Being a real-time 3D engine, Verge3D offers two main methods to handle transparent objects: alpha blending and alpha clipping (usually with an image mask). Blending enables combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, using the foreground color's alpha as blending factor. Clipping, on the other hand, simply discards all pixels with alpha less than some predefined threshold (by default 0, but can be changed in material settings).
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-common/blending-vs-clipping.jpg" alt="Blender Alpha Blend vs Alpha Clip comparison">

    <p>
      Blending enables for smooth transitions, generally looks nicer but computationally more expensive than clipping. It may also produce z-sorting artifacts when polygons appear to be rendered in wrong order. Clipping works best for visualizing numerous small objects (such as grass or tree leaves). It also produces hard edges without any transitions which may be aliased.
    </p>


    [anchor:alpha_add]

    <h2>Additive Compositing (aka Additive Blending)</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D also offers a special method for rendering transparent surfaces called additive compositing. By blending in additive manner and excluding polygons from pixel depth comparison you can get rid of transparency artifacts.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-common/no-depth-writes.jpg" alt="Alpha blend vs additive compositing">

    <p>
      To enable this mode, use the following material setup. Replace *Glossy BSDF* with the actual nodes you require for your material.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/additive-blending-nodes.jpg" alt="Additive blending material setup in Blender">

    <p>
      Also disable the *Depth Write* option located on the *Verge3D Settings* panel:</p>
    </p>

    [anchor:rendering_order]

    <h2>Rendering Order (aka Z-index)</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D does not perform sorting of polygons inside objects, but rather performs sorting <i>between</i> objects. This provides correct blending in most cases but sometimes one may need to forcibly change the rendering order for an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      To modify the rendering order for a particular object, change the numeric field in the Verge3D settings panel. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/rendering-order.jpg" alt="Render order setting" style="max-width: 326px">

    <p>
      So, if you have a transparent, continuous object in the rear and want other transparent objects in the front to render correctly, set some negative value as the rendering order of the rear object.
    </p>

    [anchor:oit_rendering]

    <h2>Order-Independent Transparency (OIT)</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D allows the use of an approximate order-independent transparency technique, which do not require rendering geometry in sorted order, so it solves most transparency issues without any of the above considerations.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-common/oit-example.jpg" alt="Order-Independent Transparency example">

    <p>
      OIT can be enabled though the <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#global_rendering_properties_verge3d">Verge3D Settings panel</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/oit.jpg" alt="Order-Independent Transparency setting in Blender" style="max-width: 449px;">

    <p>Known limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        OIT is only compatible with WebGL 2, otherwise it has no effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        OIT is ignored by <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#light_probes">Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</a> and <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#reflection_plane_light_probes">Reflection Plane Light Probes</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        May not work well with high opacity objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should not be used together with *MSAA* (multisample anti-aliasing) in scenes with 2 or more opaque objects. Instead you can use *FXAA* (fast approximate anti-aliasing) which is fully compatible with OIT.
      </li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:transparency_gltf]

    <h2>Transparency for glTF-compliant Materials</h2>

    <p>
      In order to enable transparency for such materials, add alpha mask information to the alpha channel of the base color texture. Also you can tweak the alpha channel with the <strong>Alpha</strong> input of the Principled BSDF node.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-blender/gltf-PBR-ztransparency.jpg" alt="Transparent glTF material">

    <p>
      Use the <strong>Blend Mode</strong> dropdown to choose between the supported transparency modes: *Opaque*, *Alpha Clip*, or *Alpha Blend*.
