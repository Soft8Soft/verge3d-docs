    <h1>Material System Overview / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following types of materials:

    [anchor:Eevee]

    <h2>Eevee Materials</h2>

    <p>
      Eevee is Blender's real-time renderer which we recommend to use with Verge3D.
    </p>

    <p>
    See the detailed information on supported Eevee nodes in this <a href="manual/en/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html">reference</a>.
    </p>



    [anchor:Cycles]

    <h2>Cycles Materials</h2>

    <p>
      Cycles is Blender's raytracing renderer and can be recreated in real-time rendering engines such as Verge3D only approximately. Most Cycles nodes are interchangeable with Eevee's, so you can transfer your existing Cycles-based assets online without much hurdle.

    [anchor:glTF_compliant_PBR]

    <h2>glTF-compliant PBR Materials</h2>

    <p>
      These materials follow <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-gltf-2.0-specification" target="_blank">glTF 2.0 standard</a> for physically based materials (PBR). According to this standard, material information is encoded in a set of textures: base color, occlusion-roughness-metallic packed in R, G and B channels, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Verge3D, glTF-compliant PBR materials are represented using the <b>Principled BSDF</b> shader node to inputs of which PBR textures are connected.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, although this is not part of the glTF 2.0 standard, you can set up world nodes to serve as environment.
    </p>

      Check out the <a href="manual/en/blender/GLTF-Materials.html">glTF PBR Materials</a> chapter for more information on how to set up glTF-compliant PBR materials.
