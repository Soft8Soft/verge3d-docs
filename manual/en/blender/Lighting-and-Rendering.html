    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      This page contains the information about lighting and rendering features which can be used with Verge3D for Blender.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D is designed to represent Blender's Eevee renderer as closely as possible. It supports physically-based shading, lights, shadows and image-based lighting (IBL).
    </p>


    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline. You can illuminate your entire scene with just an environment map alone, without using any light objects. See the [demoLink:scooter/index] demo as an example of this approach.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/symQy5gEHdY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>
      The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch. Here is the basic <em>World nodes</em> setup which uses the same texture for both environment lighting and background:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/world-nodes.webp" alt="Blender basic world shader setup">

    <p>
      When using HDR textures, make sure you set the *Color Space* property to *Linear Rec.709*.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, to prevent excessive lighting coming from a fake sun light implicitly created by Blender Eevee, you should set the *Sun* →*Threshold* setting to `0`:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/world-sun-threshold.webp" alt="Blender sun threshold setting" style="max-width: 478px">


    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
      In some cases, using just image-based lighting to illuminate your scene is not enough. If you'd like to simulate some additional light source, need dynamic shadows, or if you need to move your lights (as with car lights), you may use direct light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following light types:
    </p>

    [anchor:point_lights]

    <h3>Point Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-point.webp" alt="Blender point light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>
      *Color*, *Power*, *Shadow* (on/off only), and *Custom Distance* properties are supported in Verge3D. The *Power* property of point lights can be animated.
    </p>

    [anchor:sun_lights]

    <h3>Sun Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-sun.webp" alt="Blender sun light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>
      *Color*, *Strength*, *Shadow* (on/off only) properties are supported in Verge3D. The *Strength* property of sun lights can be animated.
    </p>

    [anchor:spot_lights]

    <h3>Spot Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-spot.webp" alt="Blender spot light properties" style="max-width: 324px">

    <p>
      *Color*, *Power*, *Beam Shape*: *Size* and *Blend*, *Shadow* (on/off only), *Custom Distance* properties are supported in Verge3D. The *Power* property of spot lights can be animated.
    </p>

    [anchor:area_lights]

    <h3>Area Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-area.webp" alt="Blender area light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>
      *Color*, *Power*, *Shadow* (on/off only), *Custom Distance*, as well *Size* for *Square*-shaped and *Size X*/*Size Y* for *Rectangular*-shaped lights are supported in Verge3D. *Disk* and *Ellipse* shapes are not supported. The *Power* property of area lights can be animated.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      In Verge3D, shadows casted from area lights look the same as from point lights.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadow Properties</h3>

    <p>
      Since Blender's native shadows properties (except on/off checkbox) are not supported in Verge3D, you should assign shadow properties on the *Verge3D Settings* panel. See the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shadows.html#per_light_settings">corresponding section</a> for more info.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Spherical Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Spherical reflection light probes are objects intended for adding indirect lighting locally by generating a local reflection cubemap. This type of light probe objects add specular indirect lighting to a scene.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V39heuWD_vo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      All properties except *Falloff* are supported in Verge3D.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-sphere.webp" alt="Blender sphere light probe properties" style="max-width: 370px">

            Far clip distance. Objects located further than this value won't be rendered into the reflection cubemap.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Custom Parallax</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable custom settings for the parallax correction. This group of settings defines a parallax volume, which is used to project the lighting captured by the probe. If *Custom Parallax* not enabled the parallax effect is calculated based on *Type* and *Radius/Size* of the influence volume.

          <dt>Invert Visibility Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            Invert the selection of objects visible to this probe if *Visibility Collection* is specified.
          </dd>

          <dt>Custom Influence</dt>
          <dd>
            Enable custom influence settings. This group of settings allows defining a collection of objects that will be affected by this light probe. *Influence Collection* (if specified) will be used instead of the *Type* and *Radius/Distance* general probe settings.
            <dl>
              <dt>Influence Collection</dt>
              <dd>
                Limit objects that should be affected by this light probe to this collection. If specified it is used instead of the *Type* and *Radius/Distance* general probe settings.
              </dd>

              <dt>Invert Influence Collection</dt>
              <dd>
                Invert the selection of objects affected by this probe if *Influence Collection* is specified.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Similarly to global environment lighting, the <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#cubemap_size">Env. Map Size</a> property controls the size of the cubemap texture used by spherical light probes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#ibl_environment_mode">IBL Env. Mode</a> setting also affects cubemaps generated by *Reflection Cubemap* objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to implementation specifics there are differences of how *Sphere* light probes behave in Blender and in Verge3D:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Blender supports multiple light probes per object while Verge3D only a single one. That's why objects in Verge3D use a single cubemap either from a *Reflection Cubemap* object or from the world environment. *Falloff* is not supported.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blender doesn't use Backface Culling for meshes by default while Verge3D does. Hence in Blender objects placed inside the probe's influence volume can appear on the reflection cubemap as black spots due to back faces being rendered if the *Clipping Start*/*Clipping End* settings are not properly adjusted. This doesn't happen in Verge3D by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        When rendering objects into a light probe's cubemap (baking) Blender considers only the diffuse component of an object's material, while Verge3D renders them no different from how they are rendered on the main scene. That's why for example fully metallic objects are rendered black in Blender, but in Verge3D they still reflect the world environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the *Visibility Collection* property to work in Blender it's required that the specified collection is also linked to the scene. It's not needed in Verge3D and it's enough to just assign an object to a collection.
      </li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:reflection_plane_light_probes]

    <h2>Planar Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Planar reflection light probes is an effective way to apply real-time reflections (indirect lighting) to planar objects, such as mirrors, floors, walls, etc.
    </p>

    <figure style="max-width: 776px">
      <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-reflection-plane-example.jpg" alt="Load Unload demo with reflection planes">
      <figcaption>Reflection planes are used to render the floor reflections in the [demoLink:load_unload] demo.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      The following properties are supported:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-plane.webp" alt="Blender plane light probe properties" style="max-width: 370px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        Influence distance of the probe.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clipping Offset</dt>
      <dd>
        Near camera clipping for objects rendered in the light probe.
      </dd>
      <dt>Falloff</dt>
      <dd>
        Controls how fast the probe influence decreases.
      </dd>
      <dt>Visibility Collection</dt>
      <dd>
        Collection of the objects visible for the probe.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
      Planar reflection probes can greatly reduce performance of your scene, since they multiply the number of draw calls by a factor <strong>N+1</strong>. To make rendering faster, specify a limited set of objects as the *Visibility Collection* property.
    </p>


    [anchor:background]

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      By default Blender and Verge3D render the same image for background and environment lighting. To render them separate, use the advanced World nodes setup based on *Is Camera Ray* output of the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#Light_Path">Light Path</a> node. For example, to set the background color to solid grey and continue using the HDR map for environment lighting:
    </p>

    [anchor:global_rendering_properties]

    <h2>Global Rendering Properties</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following properties accessible on the Blender's *Render Properties* panel.
    </p>

    [anchor:global_rendering_properties_color_management]

    <h3>Color Management Panel</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/rendering-properties-color-management.jpg" alt="Blender Color Management properties" style="max-width: 327px">

    <h3>Verge3D Settings Panel</h3>

    <p>
      In addition, there is a panel with Verge3D-specific rendering/export properties:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/rendering-properties-verge3d.webp" alt="Verge3D global rendering properties" style="max-width: 370px">

      <dt>Export Custom Props</dt>
      <dd>Export custom properties assigned on Blender objects. Check out this <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#get_custom_props">page</a> to learn how to retreive these properties in Verge3D.</dd>

      <dt>Bake Modifiers</dt>
      <dd>Verge3D does not support Blender modifiers in run-time, however you can automatically bake them before export by enabling this property.</dd>

      <dt>Bake Text</dt>

      <dt>Anti-Aliasing</dt>
      <dd>
        Select anti-aliasing algorithm used to render the scene:
        <dl>
          <dt>Auto</dt>
          <dd>Use system default method. In most cases this would be MSAA 4x.</dd>

          <dt>MSAA 4x</dt>
          <dd>Prefer multisample anti-aliasing with 4x samples if the target hardware supports it. Provides decent quality and performance.</dd>

          <dt>MSAA 8x</dt>
          <dd>Prefer multisample anti-aliasing with 8x samples if the target hardware supports it. This algorithm provides better AA quality at the expense of reduced performance.</dd>

          <dt>MSAA 16x</dt>
          <dd>Prefer multisample anti-aliasing with 16x samples if the target hardware supports it. This algorithm provides way better AA quality compared to MSAA 4x/8x but has the worst performance.</dd>

          <dt>FXAA</dt>
          <dd>Force fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA). Enable this algorithm if you experience <a href="manual/en/introduction/Hardware-Related-Issues.html#aa_issues">aliasing issues with procedural textures</a>.</dd>

          <dt>None</dt>
          <dd>Disable anti-aliasing. Use this option as an aggressive performance optimization when quality does not matter.</dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Use HDR Rendering</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Enable high-dynamic-range rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          If activated, Verge3D will use 16-bit float textures as rendering buffers. This feature can significantly improve rendering of the Bloom post-processing as well as smoothness of node-based gradient textures. The downside of this — increased GPU memory consumption and reduced performance.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This feature is not related to <strong>.hdr</strong> textures which are commonly used to produce image-based lighting, thus activating it won't improve rendering of such textures.

    [anchor:ambient_occlusion]

    <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>

    <p>
      Ambient Occlusion is a rendering technique that improves a scene's realism by adding soft shadows from indirect (ambient) lighting based on how much the point is exposed to the light sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blender uses Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO) and Verge3D Implements the same technique under the hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following AO settings which can be found in the *Ambient Occlusion* section on the *Verge3D Settings* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/ambient-occlusion-properties.webp" alt="Blender Ambient Occlusion properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Ambient Occlusion</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable Ambient Occlusion in the scene.
      </dd>
      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        The radius (in system units) within which to calculate ambient occlusion.  Higher values make the effect more noticeable by over-darkening and expanding the area of it, but also can decrease performance. Lower values make occlusion less noticeable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Factor</dt>
      <dd>
        The strength of the occlusion effect.
      </dd>
      <dt>Trace Precision</dt>
      <dd>
        Higher precision means more accurate occlusion at increased performance cost. Lower precision means better performance but the effect appears less prominent.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bent Normals</dt>
      <dd>
        Use modified (or "bent") normals to sample the environment instead of the original ones. The modified normals represent the least occluded direction and make environment lighting a bit more realistic.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    [demo:ambient_occlusion]


    [anchor:outline_rendering]

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.

    </figure>

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect on the Blender's *Render Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-settings.jpg" alt="Outline effect properties" style="max-width: 367px">

    <p>
      then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Edge Strength</dt>
      <dd>Outlining strength factor.</dd>

      <dt>Edge Glow</dt>
      <dd>Intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</dd>

      <dt>Edge Thickness</dt>
      <dd>Outline edge thickness factor.</dd>

      <dt>Pulse Period</dt>
      <dd>Pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</dd>

      <dt>Visible Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Visible edge color.</dd>

      <dt>Hidden Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</dd>

      <dt>Render Hidden Edge</dt>
      <dd>Enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
      Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.

    <dl>
      <dt>Render Order</dt>
      <dd>
        Modifies the rendering order for a particular object. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered. In most cases, you need to tweak this value when using Blend transparency to eliminate transparency artifacts.
      </dd>

      <dt>Fix Ortho Zoom</dt>
      <dd>
        Apply inverse orthographic camera zoom as scaling factor for this object. Enable this property for object parented to ortho camera, so they don't move/scale when the user zooms the camera.

    [anchor:hidpi_rendering]

    <h2>Rendering on HiDPI (aka Retina) Screens</h2>

    <p>
      As of today, most mobile and many desktop screens have high pixel density (so called "Retina" displays). These displays allow you to substantially increase quality of your renderings. The downside of rendering many pixels is reduced performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two approaches how to make your content look better and do not make your scenes really slow:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using somewhat better resolution, e.g by setting screen scaling factor to 1.5 or so. See <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#set_screen_scale">here</a> for more info.</li>
      <li>Using HiDPI rendering only for important content, such as text, screen-space UI elements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The latter approach can be easily achieved by enabling the *HiDPI Compositing* property located on the *Verge3D Settings* panel (*Object Properties* tab):
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/hidpi-compositing.webp" alt="Verge3D HiDPI compositing properties" style="max-width: 326px">

    <figure>
      <img src="files/lighting-blender/hidpi-compositing-example.webp" alt="Example of HiDPI rendering in Blender">
      <figcaption>HiDPI compositing is used to display the UI controls and text in the [demoLink:e-learning] demo.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      However, rendering HiDPI content in a separate pass has some limitations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can't apply any post-processing effects to the objects rendered in HiDPI pass.</li>
      <li>Objects are not affected by the depth of the objects rendered before them. This may produce artifacts like on the screenshot below (green — regular object, blue — HiDPI object, but in reality the green one is nearest to the viewer):<br><img src="files/lighting-blender/hidpi-compositing-depth-issue.webp" alt="Verge3D HiDPI compositing depth issue" style="max-width: 600px"></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This basically means that the HiDPI Compositing should be used primarily for UI elements or camera-parented objects.
    </p>

    [anchor:visibility_breakpoints]

    <h2>Visibility Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Visibility Breakpoints</em> allow you to show/hide content depending on 3D viewport width/height or orientation settings. The most important use case of this feature — adapting your scene to different screen sizes and orientations. E.g you may have two different models for portrait and landscape screen orientations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If assigned to the current camera, tries to switch to an alternative camera (must have acceptable visibility breakpoints) in the scene, if no alternative camera is found, does nothing.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Use the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/duplicate_linked.html" target="_blank">Duplicate Linked</a> Blender feature to share geometry among two objects. One object will be rendered in portrait mode while another in landscape mode. This way you can save a lot of GPU memory and decrease app loading time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the breakpoints on the *Object Properties* panel:

    <h2>Line Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      With this feature you can render Blender objects by using lines. The most common use case of Line Rendering is drawing curve objects, which do not have any geometry on their own. However, you can also apply this technique to regular meshes and surfaces:

      Line Rendering is activated in *Verge3D Settings* located on the *Object Data Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/line-rendering-properties.jpg" alt="Line rendering properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    [anchor:clipping_planes]

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
