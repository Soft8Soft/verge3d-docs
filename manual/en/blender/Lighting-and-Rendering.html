    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      This page contains the information about lighting and rendering features which can be used with Verge3D for Blender.
    </p>

    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D is designed to represent Blender's Eevee renderer as closely as possible. It supports physically-based shading, lights, shadows and image-based lighting (IBL).
    </p>


    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline. You can illuminate your entire scene with just an environment map alone, without using any light objects. See the [demoLink:scooter] demo as an example of this approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch. Here is the basic <em>World nodes</em> setup which uses the same texture for both environment lighting and background:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/world-nodes.jpg" alt="Blender basic world shader setup" style="max-width: 852px">

    <p class="note">
      When using HDR textures, make sure you set the *Color Space* setting to *Linear*.
    </p>

    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
      In some cases, using just image-based lighting to illuminate your scene is not enough. If you'd like to simulate some additional light source, need dynamic shadows, or if you need to move your lights (as with car lights), you may use direct light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following light types:
    </p>

    [anchor:point_lights]

    <h3>Point Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-point.jpg" alt="Blender point light properties" style="max-width: 320px">

    <p>*Color* and *Power* properties are supported in Verge3D. You can also animate the *Power* property.</p>

    [anchor:sun_lights]

    <h3>Sun Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-sun.jpg" alt="Blender sun light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>*Color* and *Strength* properties are supported in Verge3D. You can also animate the *Strength* property.</p>

    [anchor:spot_lights]

    <h3>Spot Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-spot.jpg" alt="Blender spot light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>*Color*, *Power*, *Spot Shape*: *Size* and *Blend* properties are supported in Verge3D. You can also animate the *Power* property.</p>

    [anchor:area_lights]

    <h3>Area Lights</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-properties-area.jpg" alt="Blender area light properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>*Color*, *Power*, as well *Size* for *Square*-shaped and *Size X*/*Size Y* for *Rectangular*-shaped lights are supported in Verge3D. *Disk* and *Ellipse* shapes are not supported. The *Power* property of area lights can be animated.</p>

    <p class="note">
      In addition, you can assign shadow properties on your lights. See the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shadows.html#per_light_settings">corresponding section</a> for more info.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Reflection Cubemap Light Probes are objects intended for adding indirect lighting locally by
      generating a local reflection cubemap. This type of light probe objects add
      specular indirect lighting to a scene.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V39heuWD_vo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      The following properties are supported:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-reflection-cubemap.png" alt="Blender light probe properties" style="max-width: 453px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Probe</dt>
      <dd>
        General probe settings:

        <dl>
          <dt>Type</dt>
          <dd>
            Type of the influence volume: *Sphere* or *Box*. Only objects
            located inside this volume are affected by the probe's lighting.
          </dd>

          <dt>Radius/Size</dt>
          <dd>
            Controls the size of the influence volume. You can also change
            object scaling and make the shape of the influence volume
            non-uniform.
          </dd>

          <dt>Intensity</dt>
          <dd>
            The intensity of the indirect lighting. Any value different from 1.0
            is not physically correct.
          </dd>

          <dt>Clipping Start</dt>
          <dd>
            Near clip distance. Objects located closer than this value won't be
            rendered into the reflection cubemap.
          </dd>

          <dt>Clipping End</dt>
          <dd>
            Far clip distance. Objects located further than this value won't be
            rendered into the reflection cubemap.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Visibility</dt>
      <dd>
        Object visibility settings:

        <dl>
          <dt>Visibility Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            Limit objects that should appear on the reflection cubemap to this
            collection. If not specified all scene objects are used.
          </dd>

          <dt>Invert Visibility Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            Invert the selection of objects visible to this probe if
            *Visibility Collection* is specified.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Custom Parallax</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable custom settings for the parallax correction. This group of settings
        defines a parallax volume, which is used to project the lighting
        captured by the probe. If *Custom Parallax* not enabled the parallax
        effect is calculated based on *Type* and *Radius/Size* of the influence
        volume.

        <dl>
          <dt>Type</dt>
          <dd>
            Type of the parallax volume: *Sphere* or *Box*.

          <dd>
            The size of the parallax volume.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Custom Influence</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable custom influence settings. This group of settings allows defining
        a collection of objects that will be affected by this light probe.
        *Influence Collection* (if specified) will be used instead of the
        *Type* and *Radius/Distance* general probe settings.

        <dl>
          <dt>Influence Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            Limit objects that should be affected by this light probe to this
            collection. If specified it is used instead of the *Type* and
            *Radius/Distance* general probe settings.
          </dd>

          <dt>Invert Influence Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            Invert the selection of objects affected by this probe if
            *Influence Collection* is specified.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In order to see in Blender's viewport the results of using
      *Reflection Cubemap* objects you need to bake their cubemaps first via the
      *Bake Cubemap Only* or *Bake Indirect Lighting* buttons both located in
      the *Indirect Lighting* panel, which is in the *Render Properties* tab.<br/><br/>

      Also the <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#cubemap_size">Cubemap Size</a>
      property controls the size of the cubemap texture used by *Reflection Cubemap*
      objects.<br/><br/>

      The <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#ibl_environment_mode">IBL Env. Mode</a>
      setting also affects cubemaps generated by *Reflection Cubemap* objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to implementation specifics there are differences of how
      *Reflection Cubemap* light probes behave in Blender and in Verge3D:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Blender supports multiple light probes per object while Verge3D only
          a single one. That's why objects in Verge3D use a single cubemap
          either from a *Reflection Cubemap* object or from the world environment.
          *Falloff* is not supported.
        </li>

        <li>
          Blender doesn't use Backface Culling for meshes by default while
          Verge3D does. Hence in Blender objects placed inside the probe's
          influence volume can appear on the reflection cubemap as black spots
          due to back faces being rendered if the *Clipping Start*/*Clipping End*
          settings are not properly adjusted. This doesn't happen in Verge3D by
          default.
        </li>

        <li>
          When rendering objects into a light probe's cubemap (baking) Blender
          considers only the diffuse component of an object's material, while
          Verge3D renders them no different from how they are rendered on the
          main scene. That's why for example fully metallic objects are rendered
          black in Blender, but in Verge3D they still reflect the world
          environment.
        </li>

        <li>
          For the *Visibility Collection* property to work in Blender it's
          required that the specified collection is also linked to the scene.
          It's not needed in Verge3D and it's enough to just assign an object
          to a collection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    [anchor:reflection_plane_light_probes]

    <h2>Reflection Plane Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Reflection Plane light probes is an effective way to apply real-time reflections (indirect lighting) to planar objects, such as mirrors, floors, walls, etc.
    </p>

    </figure>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      The following properties are supported:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-reflection-plane.jpg" alt="Blender reflection plane properties" style="max-width: 368px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        Influence distance of the probe.
      </dd>
      <dt>Falloff</dt>
      <dd>
        Controls how fast the probe influence decreases.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clipping Offset</dt>
      <dd>
        Near camera clipping for objects rendered in the light probe.
      </dd>
      <dt>Visibility Collection</dt>
      <dd>
        Collection of the objects visible for the probe.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
      Planar reflection probes can greatly reduce performance of your scene, since they multiply the number of draw calls by a factor <strong>N+1</strong>. To make rendering faster, specify a limited set of objects as the *Visibility Collection* property.
    </p>


    [anchor:background]

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      By default Blender and Verge3D render the same image for background and environment lighting. To render them separate, use the advanced World nodes setup based on *Is Camera Ray* output of the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#Light_Path">Light Path</a> node. For example, to set the background color to solid grey and continue using the HDR map for environment lighting:

    [anchor:ambient_occlusion]

    <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>

    <p>
      Ambient Occlusion is a rendering technique that improves a scene's realism
      by adding soft shadows from indirect (ambient) lighting based on how much
      the point is exposed to the light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blender uses Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO)
      (<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/render_settings/ambient_occlusion.html">link</a>)
      and Verge3D Implements the same technique under the hood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following AO settings which can be found in the
      *Ambient Occlusion* section on the *Render Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/ambient-occlusion-properties.jpg" alt="Blender Ambient Occlusion properties" style="max-width: 323px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Ambient Occlusion</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable Ambient Occlusion in the scene.
      </dd>
      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        The radius (in system units) within which to calculate ambient occlusion.
        Higher values make the effect more noticeable by over-darkening and
        expanding the area of it, but also can decrease performance. Lower
        values make occlusion less noticeable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Factor</dt>
      <dd>
        The strength of the occlusion effect.
      </dd>
      <dt>Trace Precision</dt>
      <dd>
        Higher precision means more accurate occlusion at increased performance
        cost. Lower precision means better performance but the effect appears
        less prominent.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bent Normals</dt>
      <dd>
        Use modified (or "bent") normals to sample the environment instead of
        the original ones. The modified normals represent the least occluded
        direction and make environment lighting a bit more realistic.

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.
    </p>

    <figure style="max-width: 819px">
      <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-example.jpg" alt="Example of outline effect">
      <figcaption>Outline effect used to highlight selections in the Industrial Robot demo.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect on the Blender's *Render Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-settings.jpg" alt="Outline effect properties" style="max-width: 367px">

    <p>
      then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Edge Strength</dt>
      <dd>Outlining strength factor.</dd>

      <dt>Edge Glow</dt>
      <dd>Intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</dd>

      <dt>Edge Thickness</dt>
      <dd>Outline edge thickness factor.</dd>

      <dt>Pulse Period</dt>
      <dd>Pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</dd>

      <dt>Visible Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Visible edge color.</dd>

      <dt>Hidden Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</dd>

      <dt>Render Hidden Edge</dt>
      <dd>Enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.</p>


    [anchor:per_object_rendering_properties]

    <h2>Per-Object Rendering Properties</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following additional rendering properties for your geometry objects:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/rendering-properties.jpg" alt="Blender per-object rendering properties" style="max-width: 335px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Render Order</dt>
      <dd>
        Modifies the rendering order for a particular object. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered. In most cases, you need to tweak this value when using Blend transparency to eliminate transparency artifacts.
      </dd>

      <dt>Frustum Culling</dt>
      <dd>
        Enables/disables frustum culling optimization for the object. Uncheck this option if you have some skinned object which can move beyond the screen space to prevent it from being culled.
      </dd>

      <dt>Receive Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        Render or not shadows on the given object. See <a href="manual/en/blender/Shadows.html#per_object_material_settings">here</a> for more info.
      </dd>

      <dt>HiDPI Compositing</dt>
      <dd>
        Render object using HiDPI compositing pass. See <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#hidpi_rendering">below</a> for more info.
      </dd>

      <dt>Fix Ortho Zoom</dt>
      <dd>
        Apply inverse orthographic camera zoom as scaling factor for this object. Enable this property for object parented to ortho camera, so they don't move/scale when the user zooms the camera.

        <div class="note">
          <p>If your object is still zoomed in/out, clear its Parent Inverse matrix:</p>

    [anchor:hidpi_rendering]

    <h2>Rendering on HiDPI (Retina) Screens</h2>

    <p>
      As of today, most mobile and many desktop screens have high pixel density (so called "Retina" displays). These displays allow you to substantially increase quality of your renderings. The downside of rendering many pixels is reduced performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two approaches how to make your content look better and do not make your scenes really slow:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using somewhat better resolution, e.g by setting screen scaling factor to 1.5 or so. See <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#set_screen_scale">here</a> for more info.</li>
      <li>Using HiDPI rendering only for important content, such as text, screen-space UI elements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The latter approach can be easily achieved by enabling the *HiDPI Compositing* property located on the *Object Properties* panel:
    </p>

    [anchor:visibility_breakpoints]

    <h2>Visibility Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Visibility Breakpoints</em> allow you to show/hide content depending on 3D viewport width/height or orientation settings. The most important use case of this feature — adapting your scene to different screen sizes and orientations. E.g you may have two different models for portrait and landscape screen orientations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If assigned to the current camera, tries to switch to an alternative camera (must have acceptable visibility breakpoints) in the scene, if no alternative camera is found, does nothing.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Use the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/duplicate_linked.html" target="_blank">Duplicate Linked</a> Blender feature to share geometry among two objects. One object will be rendered in portrait mode while another in landscape mode. This way you can save a lot of GPU memory and decrease app loading time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the breakpoints on the *Object Properties* panel:

    [anchor:line_rendering]

    <h2>Line Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      With this feature you can render Blender objects by using lines. The most common use case of Line Rendering is drawing curve objects, which do not have any geometry on their own. However, you can also apply this technique to regular meshes and surfaces:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/lighting-blender/line-rendering-example.jpg" alt="Object wireframes displayed with the line rendering feature">
      <figcaption>Object wireframes displayed with the line rendering feature.</figcaption>

    <p>
      Line Rendering is activated in *Verge3D Settings* located on the *Object Data Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/line-rendering-properties.jpg" alt="Line rendering properties" style="max-width: 325px">

    <p>
      Here you can also assign color and width of the rendered lines. In Verge3D lines are rendered with the Emission shader.
    </p>

    [anchor:clipping_planes]

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Clipping planes used to show the internals of a kitchen appliance.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To add a new clipping plane, use the *Clipping Plane* menu item from the Blender's *Add Object* menu:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/clipping-plane-new.jpg" alt="Adding clipping plane object in Blender">

    <p>
      The objects on your scene will be clipped in the negative *Z* direction of the clipping plane object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clipping planes have the following properties:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/clipping-plane-properties.jpg" alt="Blender clipping plane properties" style="max-width: 340px">
