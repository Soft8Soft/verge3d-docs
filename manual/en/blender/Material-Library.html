    <h1>Using Material Library / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D material library is a collection of ready-to-use materials and environments which may significantly improve your efficiecy in creating web-optimized content. Below is the description of a recommended workflow on how to install and use these libraries.

    [anchor:installing]

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>
      Material libraries are available in the Soft8Soft store in the form of themed packs:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-blender-essential-material-pack/" target="_blank">Essential Material Pack</a> (Eevee-based)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-blender-machinery-material-pack/" target="_blank">Machinery Material Pack</a> (Eevee-based)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-blender-jewelry-material-pack/" target="_blank">Jewelry Material Pack</a> (Eevee-based)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Simply unzip the archive with a library pack to any folder on your computer (e.g. in Verge3D applications folder). Open the *Blender Preferences* and go to the *File Paths* tab.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/blender-file-paths.webp" alt="Blender file paths settings" style="max-width: 766px">

    <p>
      Click on the <strong>+</strong> button on the *Asset Libraries* panel. In the appeared dialog find and select the library folder, then click *Add Asset Library*:
    </p>

    <p>
      Verify you have your new pack added to the *Asset Libraries* list:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/blender-essential-pack-path.webp" alt="Asset library added" style="max-width: 766px">

    <p>
      Done, the materials will be available right away.
    </p>


    [anchor:adding_materials]

    <h2>Adding Materials to Project</h2>

    <p>
      In order to use the material library in your project, just open the *Asset Browser* in Blender.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/blender-essential-pack.webp" alt="Essential asset pack" style="max-width: 970px">

    <p>
      Materials can be assigned on your models by a simple drag-and-drop operation.
    </p>


    [anchor:setting_up_environment]

    <h2>Setting up the Environment</h2>

    <p>
      Eevee-based materials require the environment (world shader) to be set up, otherwise the materials will look dark and non-reflective. Use the *Environments* category from the asset library to assign the proper environment. Similarly to materials, this can done by a simple drag-and-drop operation.
    </p>

      See also this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=symQy5gEHdY" target="_blank">video tutorial</a> to find out how to fine-tune your environments.
    </p>


    [anchor:uv_mapping]

    <h2>UV Mapping</h2>

    <p>
      Most materials in the library require models to be UV-mapped. Consider unwrapping your models for best results.
    </p>


    [anchor:configure_materials]

    <h2>Configure Your Materials</h2>

    <p>
      Most of the shaders offer sets of inputs by tweaking which you can create a unique material suitable for your needs.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/material-settings.jpg" alt="Material library settings">

    <p>
      Besides that, there are special inputs for easy connection of baked normal and AO maps.
    </p>


    [anchor:relocating_textures]

    <h2>Relocating Textures to App Folder</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of integrity of your application (which is important if you're transferring your project sources to a third party), you can save the textures used by appended materials in the app folder as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open the *Image Editor* (or *UV Editor*) in Blender. Select a texture from the drop-down menu, and check its file path.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths.jpg" alt="Finding image path in Blender" style="max-width: 909px">

    <p>
      If it appears that the texture is referenced from the material library folder, use the menu *Image* → *Save As* to re-save it to your application folder.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths2.jpg" alt="Resaving image in Blender" style="max-width: 909px">

    <p>
      Search for other material library textures and repeat this operation until all textures are relocated.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check the integrity of your application by moving its folder to another location in your file system. Open the .blend file and invoke *File* → *External Data* → *Report Missing Files*.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths3.jpg" alt="Checking integrity of Blender scene" style="max-width: 835px">

    <p>
      If any of the textures used in the .blend file are missing, a yellow splash warning will be shown at the bottom.
    </p>
