    <h1>glTF PBR Materials / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      If your content needs to be fully-compatible with glTF 2.0 standard <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#gltf_materials">for some reason</a>, you'll need to use the simplistic material setup. This setup is based on a limited set of Blender nodes which should be connected with each other as specified below.
    </p>

    [anchor:texture_packing]

    <h2>Texture Packing</h2>

    <p>
      The glTF 2.0 standard implies that you pack the PBR components of materials into a single image (aka ORM texture):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Occlusion factor is packed in the R channel. It's also possible to use separate texture for occlusion, but packing allows you to use less textures and thus makes your scene more size-efficient.</li>
      <li>Roughness factor is packed in the G channel.</li>
      <li>Metalness (metallic) factor is packed in the B channel.</li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:setting_up]

    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <p>
      Add the *Princlipled BSDF* shader node to your material then connect texture nodes as follows. Note that all textures are optional and any of them can be safely omitted.
    </p>

    <img src="files/physical-material-blender/gltf-material-example.jpg" alt="Example of glTF material" style="max-width: 820px">

    <ul>
      <li>
        Connect an *Image Texture* node to the *Base Color* input of the *Principled BSDF* node. *Color Space* of the texture must be set to *sRGB*.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect *Image Texture* and *Separate RGB* nodes to the *Metallic* and *Roughness* inputs of the *Principled BSDF* node. For optimal loading and rendering of the PBR shader you should pack your occlusion, roughness and metallic textures into R, G and B channels of a single texture respectively. To enable occlusion rendering, the R channel of the occlusion texture should be connected as a mix factor of the black Diffuse shader. The *Color Space* setting of this texture must be set to *Non-Color*.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect a *Normal Map* texture to the *Normal* input of the *Principled BSDF* node and an *Image Texture* node to that *Normal Map* node. The *Color Space* parameter of the texture must be set to *Non-Color*. You can also tune the normal map strength by using the *Strength* option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect an *Image Texture* node to the *Emission* input of the *Principled BSDF* node. *Color Space* of the texture must be set to *sRGB*.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you need to tune your *Base Color* texture, e.g make it darker or mix with some other color, use *Multiply* node as shown on the picture below:</p>

    <img src="files/physical-material-blender/gltf-material-color-factor.jpg" alt="glTF material with Multiply node" style="max-width: 844px;">

    <p>
      You can also use the *Alpha* input to tune your material transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see the preview of the *Principled BSDF* shader in the Blender viewport, you can set the display method of the *3D View* to *Rendering* or just preview your scene in Verge3D with the *Sneak Peak* button on the same panel.
    </p>


    [anchor:exporting_substance]

    <h2>Exporting Textures from Substance Painter</h2>

    <p>
      The models and the baked normal and occlusion maps (if any) can be loaded in Substance Painter via OBJ format.
    </p>

    <img src="files/physical-material-blender/substance_screenshot.jpg" alt="Substance Painter" style="max-width: 819px;">

    <p>
      Overall 3 maps are produced in this software in the end: base color/transparency, occlusion/roughness/metallic and normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      To facilitate exporting textures from Substance Painter and to ensure maximum capabilities within the Verge3D engine we recommend using <a href="files/physical-material-blender/Verge3D_for_Blender.spexp" target="_blank">Verge3D export preset</a>. Place this preset file to the *export-presets* folder usually located in the <strong>My Documents\Allegorithmic\Substance Painter\shelf\</strong> directory (create it if does not exist).
    </p>

    <img src="files/physical-material-blender/phmat_08.png" alt="Export material from Substance Painter">

    <p>
      When exporting textures from Substance Painter, choose *Verge3d for Blender* the export dialog window so that all generated textures are compatible with the glTF 2.0 standard Verge3D is based on.
    </p>


    [anchor:export_to_gltf_in_runtime]

    <h2>Exporting to glTF in Runtime</h2>

    <p>
      With *export to gltf* puzzle you can export your models or the entire scene in realtime. Then you can download the exported model or upload to the server for permanent storage. See more in the puzzle's <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Scenes.html#export_to_gltf">reference</a>.
