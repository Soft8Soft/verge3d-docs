    <h1>Shape Keys (aka Morphing) / Blender</h1>

    <p>Shape Keys (called Morphing in Verge3D) is a feature which allows you to modify mesh objects in real-time. The most common use case for this feature is creating parametric objects which can change their dimensions, shape, thickness, holes, profiles etc.</p>

    [anchor:animation]

    <h2>Animation</h2>

    <p>To animate shape keys in Verge3D, add keyframes for their <strong>Value</strong> parameter. The animation of shape keys works exactly the same as for any other animation parameter. You can run you playback at application start or use <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html">animation puzzles</a> for that purpose.</p>


    [anchor:controlling_with_puzzles]

    <h2>Controlling via Puzzles</h2>

    <p>To manipulate your shape keys in real-time there are two puzzles: <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#get_morph_factor">get morph factor</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#set_morph_factor">set morph factor</a>.</p>
