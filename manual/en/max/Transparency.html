    <h1>Transparency / 3ds Max</h1>

    <p>
      Here we show how to enable transparency for Standard, Physical and glTF-compliant PBR materials in 3ds Max.
    </p>

    [demo:transparency]

    [anchor:blended_vs_masked]

    <h2>Blended vs Masked</h2>

    <p>
    Being a real-time 3D engine, Verge3D offers two main methods to handle transparent objects: alpha blending and alpha clipping (usually with an image mask). Blending enables combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, using the foreground color's alpha as blending factor. Clipping, on the other hand, simply discards all pixels with alpha less than some predefined threshold (always equal to 0.5 in Verge3D for 3ds Max).
    </p>

    <p>
    Blending enables for smooth transitions, generally looks nicer but computationally more expensive than clipping. It may also produce z-sorting artifacts when polygons appear to be rendered in wrong order. Clipping works best for visualizing numerous small objects (such as grass or tree leaves). It also produces hard edges without any transitions which may be aliased.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use <strong>Alpha Mode</strong> dropdown in material settings to choose between blending and masking.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/alpha-mode.jpg" alt="Choosing transparency mode in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 368px">

    <p>
      There is also variation of the *Mask* mode called *Coverage*. It uses MSAA rendering to improve the quality of alpha clipping.
    </p>


    [anchor:alpha_add]

    <h2>Additive Compositing (aka Additive Blending)</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D also offers a special method for rendering transparent surfaces called additive compositing. By blending in additive manner and excluding polygons from pixel depth comparison you can get rid of transparency artifacts.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-common/no-depth-writes.jpg" alt="Alpha blend vs additive compositing">

    <p>
      To enable this mode select *Add* in the *Alpha Mode* dropdown and uncheck the *Depth Write* option in material settings to enable this mode. In addition, you'll need to increase the *Rendering Order* value in <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#per_object_rendering_settings">object settings</a> to make your transparent object rendered above all.
    </p>


    [anchor:oit_rendering]

    <h2>Order-Independent Transparency (OIT)</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D allows the use of an approximate order-independent transparency technique, which do not require rendering geometry in sorted order, so it solves most transparency issues without any of the above considerations.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-common/oit-example.jpg" alt="Order-Independent Transparency example">

    <p>OIT can be enabled though the <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#global_rendering_settings">Verge3D Settings panel</a>.</p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/oit.jpg" alt="Order-Independent Transparency setting in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 340px;">

    <p>Known limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        OIT is only compatible with WebGL 2, otherwise it has no effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        OIT is ignored by <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#light_probes">Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</a> and <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#reflection_plane_light_probes">Reflection Plane Light Probes</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        May not work well with high opacity objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should not be used together with *MSAA* (multisample anti-aliasing) in scenes with 2 or more opaque objects. Instead you can use *FXAA* (fast approximate anti-aliasing) which is fully compatible with OIT.
      </li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:physical_materials]

    <h2>Transparency for Physical Materials</h2>

    <p>
    Transparency of physical materials can be tweaked using the material setting of the same name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/physical-transparency.jpg" alt="Transparency settings of Physical materials" style="max-width: 342px">

    <p>Parameters:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>*Transparency* — transparency amount, color and roughness. The color and roughness parameters supported only for refraction-based transparency (*thin-walled* off).</li>
      <li>*Thin-walled* — use generic (*thin-walled* on) or refraction-based (*thin-walled* off) transparency.</li>
      <li>*Alpha Mode* — material transparency mode.</li>
      <li>*Depth Write* — disable for additive transparency composing (see <a href="manual/en/max/Transparency.html#alpha_add">above</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">By default in 3ds Max, the *Thin-walled* parameter is unchecked, which disables the most typical transparency rendering you expected to see in your interactive app. Always keep an eye on this setting when you're dealing with the transparent physical materials.</p>

    <p>
    Any combination of maps and images can be used to influence the transparency via the <strong>Transparency Map</strong> input.
    </p>

    [anchor:standard_materials]

    <h2>Transparency for Standard Materials</h2>

    <p>
    Transparency in standard materials can be tweaked using <strong>Opacity</strong> in material settings.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/standard-simple.jpg" alt="Tweaking transparency of Standard materials in 3ds Max">

    <p>
    The <strong>Opacity</strong> input of standard materials can be used to create interesting dependencies for better realism.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/standard-falloff.jpg" alt="Using falloff map to tweak transparency in 3ds Max">

    <p>
    An image with transparency information in its alpha channel can be used as input. A separate alpha image can also be used instead.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/texture-settings-standard.jpg" alt="3ds Max standard material with transparency">

    <p>
    Use the <strong>Alpha Mode</strong> dropdown to choose between transparency modes.
    </p>

    [anchor:gltf_materials]

    <h2>Transparency for glTF-compliant PBR Materials</h2>

    <p>
    In order to enable transparency for such materials, one should use a <i>separate</i> alpha map connected with the <strong>Transparency Map</strong> input of the physical material.
    </p>

    <img src="files/transparency-max/gltf-pbr-transparency.jpg" alt="glTF 2.0-compliant material setup in 3ds Max">

    <p>
      Use the <strong>Alpha Mode</strong> dropdown to choose between the supported transparency modes: *Auto*, *Opaque*, *Blend*, or *Mask*.
