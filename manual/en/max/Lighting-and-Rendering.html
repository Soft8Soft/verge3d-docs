    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / 3ds Max</h1>

    <p>
      This page contains the information about 3ds Max' lighting and rendering settings which can be used with Verge3D.
    </p>

    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports three renderers provided by 3ds Max: *Scanline*, *ART*, and *Arnold* (recommended). The Scanline renderer is intended for use with Standard lights and materials, while the ART/Arnold is typically used with Photometric lights and Physical materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing the right renderer is the first thing you should consider before starting to work with graphics. If you are not sure which renderer to choose, we recommend using Arnold. In order to set the renderer in 3ds Max, use the <a href="manual/en/max/Viewport-Render-Preview.html#arnold_scanline_rendering">"Render Setup..."</a> window.
    </p>


    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline based on Physical materials. You may illuminate your scene with an environment map alone, without using any light objects (as in the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gallery/scooter-3d-product-customizer/" target="_blank">Scooter demo</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIStxpAj1p8" target="_blank">video</a>.
    </p>


    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
      If you'd like to have dynamic shadows in your scene, or if you need to move the source of light (as with car lights), you may utilize <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2025/ENU/3DSMax-Lighting-Shading/files/GUID-57B15284-C5F3-46A8-BBD3-6333FE5E80DE-htm.html" target="_blank">light objects</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports two types of lights provided by 3ds Max: *standard* and *photometric*.
    </p>


    [anchor:photometric_lights]

    <h3>Photometric Lights</h3>

    <p>
      Photometric lights are typically used with <a href="manual/en/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Physical">Physical materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' Arnold renderer as reference. In addition, you may use Physical Camera <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2025/ENU/3DSMax-Rendering/files/GUID-E1A6D466-CABB-4C8A-97A9-0C191C69F9BD-htm.html" target="_blank">Exposure Control</a> settings to tweak the brightness and color range of your renderings.
    </p>


    [anchor:standard_lights]

    <h3>Standard Lights</h3>

    <p>
      Standard lights are typically used with <a href="manual/en/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Standard">Standard materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' Scanline renderer as reference.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D add-on adds a custom light probe object called *V3DReflectionCubemap*, which can be used to apply indirect lighting to objects via a local reflection cubemap.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3gV2zpvgwo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      The object can be found in the *Create* panel → *Helpers* category → *Verge3D* subcategory:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/light-probe-reflection-cubemap-create.png" alt="Adding light probe helper in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 351px">

    <p>
      A reflection cubemap object defines a volume of influence represented by a box or a sphere. All objects contained inside that volume will use a local reflection cubemap generated in runtime instead of the scene's global environment texture/color.
    </p>

    <p>
      The advantage of using a local reflection map is that it has surrounding objects baked in it, while the scene's global map only contains the background texture/color specified in Max's environment settings. Local reflection maps also have a parallax effect depending on the geometry of the <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#influence_volume">influence</a> or <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#parallax_volume">parallax</a> volume.

          </dd>

          <dt>Influence Selection Set</dt>
          <dd>
            Limit objects that should be affected by this light probe to this selection set. If specified it is used instead of the *Influence Type* and *Influence Distance* general probe settings.

    <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>

    <p>
      Planar reflection probes can greatly reduce performance of your scene, since they multiply the number of draw calls by a factor <strong>N+1</strong>. To make rendering faster, specify a limited set of reflected objects by means of the *Visibility Selection Set* property.

    [anchor:ambient_occlusion]

    <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>

    <p>
      Ambient Occlusion is a rendering technique that improves a scene's realism by adding soft shadows from indirect (ambient) lighting based on how much the point is exposed to the light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D implements Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO), which settings you can find in the *AO* section of *Verge3D Export Settings* (accessible through *Verge3D* → <strong>Export Settings...</strong> in 3ds Max menu):
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/rendering-settings-global-ao.jpg" alt="Ambient occlusion settings window" style="max-width: 272px">

    <p class="note">
      Verge3D adds the ambient occlusion effect only for *Physical Material* nodes and only if the scene has <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#environment_lighting">environment lighting</a> (either as a color or a map).
    </p>

      <dt>Bent Normals</dt>
      <dd>
        Use modified (or "bent") normals to sample the environment instead of the original ones. The modified normals represent the least occluded direction and make environment lighting a bit more realistic.

    [anchor:outline_rendering]

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.
    </p>

    <figure style="max-width: 819px">
      <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-example.jpg" alt="Example of outline effect">
      <figcaption>Outline effect used to highlight selections in the [demoLink:industrial_robot/index] demo.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect in the *Verge3D Export Settings* dialog:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/outline-settings.jpg" alt="Outline settings window" style="max-width: 272px">

    <p>
      then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Enabled</dt>
      <dd>Enable/disable the effect.</dd>

      <dt>Edge Strength</dt>
      <dd>Outlining strength factor.</dd>

      <dt>Edge Glow</dt>
      <dd>Intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</dd>

      <dt>Edge Thickness</dt>
      <dd>Outline edge thickness factor.</dd>

      <dt>Pulse Period</dt>
      <dd>Pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</dd>

      <dt>Visible Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Visible edge color.</dd>

      <dt>Hidden Edge Color</dt>
      <dd>Color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</dd>

      <dt>Render Hidden Edge</dt>
      <dd>Enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
      Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.

    <h2>Per-Object Rendering Settings</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following additional rendering properties for your objects:
    </p>

    <h3>Verge3D Rendering Params panel</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/rendering-settings.jpg" alt="Per-object rendering parameters panel" style="max-width: 319px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Render Order</dt>
      <dd>
        Modifies the rendering order for a particular object. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered. In most cases, you need to tweak this value when using Blend transparency to eliminate transparency artifacts.
      </dd>

      <dt>Frustum Culling</dt>
      <dd>
        Enables/disables frustum culling optimization for the object. Uncheck this option if you have some skinned object which can move beyond the screen space to prevent it from being culled.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params panel</h3>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/adv-rendering-settings.jpg" alt="Advanced per-object rendering parameters panel" style="max-width: 362px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Fit to Camera Edge</dt>
      <dd>
        See <a href="manual/en/max/Camera.html#fit_to_camera_edge">here</a> for more info.
      </dd>

      <dt>Visibility Breakpoints</dt>
      <dd>
        Enable object visibility breakpoints. See <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#visibility_breakpoints">here</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>HiDPI Compositing</dt>
      <dd>
        Render object using HiDPI compositing pass. See <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#hidpi_rendering">below</a> for more info.
      </dd>

      <dt>Fix Ortho Zoom</dt>
      <dd>
        Apply inverse orthographic camera zoom as scaling factor for this object. Enable this property for object parented to ortho camera, so they don't move/scale when the user zooms the camera.
      </dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:hidpi_rendering]

    <h2>Rendering on HiDPI (aka Retina) Screens</h2>

    <p>
      As of today, most mobile and many desktop screens have high pixel density (so called "Retina" displays). These displays allow you to substantially increase quality of your renderings. The downside of rendering many pixels is reduced performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two approaches how to make your content look better and do not make your scenes really slow:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using somewhat better resolution, e.g by setting screen scaling factor to `1.5` or so. See <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#set_screen_scale">here</a> for more info.</li>
      <li>Using HiDPI rendering only for important content, such as text, screen-space UI elements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The latter approach can be easily achieved by enabling the *HiDPI Compositing* property located on the *Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/hidpi-compositing.jpg" alt="Activating HiDPI compositing in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 362px">

    <figure>
      <img src="files/lighting-max/hidpi-compositing-example.webp" alt="Example of HiDPI rendering in Max">
      <figcaption>HiDPI compositing is used to display the UI controls and text in the [demoLink:e-learning] demo.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      However, rendering HiDPI content in a separate pass has some limitations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can't apply any post-processing effects to the objects rendered in HiDPI pass.</li>
      <li>Objects are not affected by the depth of the objects rendered before them. This may produce artifacts like on the screenshot below (green — regular object, blue — HiDPI object, but in reality the green one is nearest to the viewer):<br><img src="files/lighting-max/hidpi-compositing-depth-issue.webp" alt="Verge3D HiDPI compositing depth issue" style="max-width: 600px"></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This basically means that the HiDPI Compositing should be used primarily for UI elements or camera-parented objects.
    </p>

    [anchor:visibility_breakpoints]

    <h2>Visibility Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Visibility Breakpoints</em> allow you to show/hide content depending on 3D viewport width/height or orientation settings. The most important use case of this feature — adapting your scene to different screen sizes and orientations. E.g you may have two different models for portrait and landscape screen orientations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If assigned to the current camera, tries to switch to an alternative camera (must have acceptable visibility breakpoints) in the scene, if no alternative camera is found, does nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the breakpoints on the *Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/visibility-breakpoints.jpg" alt="Configuring visiblity breakpoints" style="max-width: 362px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Min Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Min Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Orientation</dt>
      <dd>
        Screen orientation the object stays visible.
      </dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:line_rendering]

    <h2>Line Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      With this feature you can render 3ds Max objects by using lines. The most common use case of Line Rendering is drawing curve objects, which do not have any geometry on their own. However, you can also apply this technique to regular meshes and surfaces:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/lighting-max/line-rendering-example.jpg" alt="Object wireframes displayed with the line rendering feature">
      <figcaption>Object wireframes displayed with the line rendering feature.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Line Rendering is activated in *Verge3D Settings* located on the *Object Data Properties* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/line-rendering-properties.jpg" alt="Line rendering properties">

    <p>
      Here you can also assign color and width of the rendered lines. In Verge3D lines are rendered with the Emission shader.
    </p>

    [demo:lines]


    [anchor:clipping_planes]

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/lighting-max/clipping-plane-example.jpg" alt="Clipping planes used to show the internals of a meat grinder">
      <figcaption>Clipping planes used to show the internals of a meat grinder.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To add a new clipping plane, use the *Create* → *Helpers* → *Verge3D* → *ClippingPlane* button in 3ds Max:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/clipping-plane-new.jpg" alt="Clipping plane settings panel in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 347px">

    <p>
      The objects on your scene will be clipped in the negative *Z* direction of the clipping plane object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clipping planes have the following parameters:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Affected Objects</dt>
      <dd>
        Selection set of the objects clipped by the plane. If empty, all scene objects will be clipped.
      </dd>
      <dt>Negated</dt>
      <dd>
        Swap clipped and unclipped sides.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clip Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        Clip shadows cast from the clipped objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Union Planes</dt>
      <dd>
        Construct a union from all the clipping planes, affecting the object, not their intersection.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section</dt>
      <dd>
        Fill cross-section between the clipping plane and the affected objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Color</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section diffuse color and opacity.
      </dd>
      <dt>Render Side</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section render side. Specify <strong>Double-sided</strong> to render complex geometry with cuts and holes.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Sect. Size</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section plane size. Increase this value if you use larger scene size.
      </dd>
    </dl>
