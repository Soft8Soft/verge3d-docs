    [contents]


    [anchor:Prerequisites]

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <h3>3ds Max</h3>

    <p>
      Verge3D works on top of Autodesk 3ds Max 2020-2023 which should be installed first. We recommend using the latest version of 3ds Max (2023 at the time of writing) for best results.
    </p>

    <h3>Operating system</h3>

    <p>
      We recommend using Verge3D on Windows 10/11 with latest video drivers installed. No admin privileges are required for installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Web browser</h3>

    <p>
      Verge3D can work in any browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Edge. We, however, recommend to use the Chrome browser for development as it is fast and provides good development tools. You might want to make it your default browser for more convenient previews.
    </p>

    [anchor:Configuring_Plugin_Path_Manually]

    <h2>Configuring Plugin Path Manually</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes Verge3D menu won't show up. This may happen due to various reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You disabled the *Auto-Configure* option in the installer.</li>
      <li>You installed and running a new version of 3ds Max.</li>
      <li>You switched Windows user.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In such the case, you may use the following procedure to configure the plugin path manually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Run 3ds Max, and select "Configure User and System Paths..." under "Customize" in the main menu bar.
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max1-2020.png" alt="3ds Max User and System Paths menu">

    <p>
      Switch to the "3rd Party Plug-ins" tab and click the "Add..." button.
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max2.png" alt="Button to add third-party plug-ins in 3ds Max">

    <p>
    Navigate to the folder in which Verge3D is installed and then to the "max_plugin" folder inside it. Click "Use Path".
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max3.png" alt="Selecting third-party plug-in path in 3ds Max">

    <p>
      Click "OK" and *re-open 3ds Max*.

    [anchor:Troubleshooting]

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>


    [anchor:no_verge3d_menu]

    <h3>Still no Verge3D Menu</h3>

    <p>
    In some rare cases, the Verge3D menu may not show up in the main menu bar even if you configured the plugin path and re-opened 3ds Max. To register the menu manually, go to *Utilities*, click *MaxScript* and select *Verge3D* in the dropdown menu. Then click *Register Verge3D menu*.
    </p>

    [anchor:verge3d_props_missing]

    <h3>Verge3D Properties on Objects are Missing</h3>

    <p>
    Custom Verge3D-specific properties are added automatically to objects upon their creation if <strong>Verge3D > Auto-Assign Verge3D Params</strong> is enabled. Verge3D params are not created though in the cases when you import a scene, open a file which was created before Verge3D was installed, or if the above-mentioned option is switched off.
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/troubleshooting-adding-object-params.jpg" alt="Adding Verge3D params to objects in 3ds Max" style="max-width: 615px">

    <p>
    Either way, you can add Verge3D settings to existing objects manually, by going to the *Utilities* tab, selecting *Verge3D* under *MAXScript* and clicking *Add Verge3D Params* for selected objects.
    </p>

    [anchor:python3_conflict]

    <h3>Module use of python37.dll conflicts with this version of Python</h3>

    <p>
      If you see this error in 3ds Max 2021+ (upon startup or when trying to export something)...
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/python3-conflict.jpg" alt="3ds Max python 3 error" style="max-width: 267px">

    <p>
      ...then it's possible that some plugin cluttered with your system environment variables (forcing 3ds Max to use an outdated version of Python).
    </p>

    <p>
      To fix it, run System Properties, by searching for <em>"edit the system environment variables"</em> and clicking on the appeared application:
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/win-environment-search-app.jpg" alt="Edit system environment variables in Windows" style="max-width: 785px">

    <p>
      In the *System Properties* dialog click on the <strong>Environment Variables...</strong> button:
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/win-system-properties.jpg" alt="Running Environment Variables settings in Windows" style="max-width: 425px">

    <p>
      In the next dialog find the *ADSK_3DSMAX_PYTHON_VERSION* variable. It might be located in the *User variables* or *System variables* list.
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/win-environment-vars.jpg" alt="Adding ADSK_3DSMAX_PYTHON_VERSION environment variable" style="max-width: 574px">

    <p>
      Replace value *2* to *3* by clicking the <strong>Edit...</strong> button. Click *OK* then restart your system.
    </p>


    [anchor:Uninstalling]

    <h2>Uninstalling</h2>

    <p>
      In order to remove Verge3D files, as well as the desktop icon and the Start menu entry, from your computer, you may use the standard *Add or remove programs* function of Windows. It won't touch the *applications* and *puzzles* folders where user files are stored, so you may remove them manually if you don't need them anymore.
    </p>

    <img src="files/installation_3ds_max/uninstalling-max.jpg" alt="Windows Apps & features dialog" style="max-width: 802px">

    <p>
      Before you uninstall Verge3D, you might need to remove custom Verge3D options assigned to your objects. To do so, go to *Utilities*, click *MaxScript* and select *Verge3D* in the dropdown menu. Then click on the *Cleanup Scene* button.
    </p>
