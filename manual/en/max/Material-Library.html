    <h1>Using Material Library / 3ds Max</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D material library is a collection of ready-to-use materials which you can assign to your 3ds Max models. Below is the description of a recommended workflow on how to install and use these materials efficiently.

    [anchor:installing]

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>
      Material library is available in Soft8Soft store in the form of the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-3ds-max-essential-material-pack/" target="_blank">3ds Max Essential Material Pack</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simply unzip the archive with a library pack to any folder on your computer. Inside this folder you can find a main <strong>.mat</strong> file which represents the material collection. There are also numerous <strong>.max</strong> files (one per material), however in most situations you don't need to touch them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The textures used in the materials are located in the *material_maps* folder. The folder *environments* contains 3 variants of HDR images that you can use for the environment (each variant comes in 3 resolutions: 1k, 2k and 4k).
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Materials to Project</h2>

    <p>
      Before adding material library, make sure your current renderer is set to *ART* or *Arnold*. In case of Arnold, you also need to specify the *Legacy 3ds Max Map Support* option:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-max/arnold-render-setup.jpg" alt="Configuring Arnold renderer with Legacy 3ds Max Map Support" style="max-width: 407px" alt="">

    <p>
      In order to use a library material in a project, invoke the <strong>Open Material Library...</strong> option in the <strong>Material/Map Browser</strong>:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-max/open-material-library.jpg" alt="Opening 3ds Max Material Library" style="max-width: 716px">

    <p>
      Then navigate to the library folder, select <strong>Verge3D 3ds Max Essential Material Pack.mat</strong> file and click *Open*:
    </p>

    <p>
      The list of materials should appear in the *Material/Map Browser*:
    </p>

    <p>
      To assign any of these to a model, select a model, then drag material to the *View* area, then click on the material by using right mouse button, then select *Assign Material to Selection*:
    </p>

    [anchor:setting_up_the_environment]

    <h2>Setting up the Environment</h2>

    <p>
      Physical materials require the environment to be set up, otherwise the materials will look dark and non-reflective. The environment is already set up in Verge3D's default cube project which you can use as a basis for your own app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, you can configure the environment from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://youtu.be/lIStxpAj1p8" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>. You can use either of HDR textures in the *environments* folder of a material pack for this purpose.
    </p>


    [anchor:uv_mapping]

    <h2>UV Mapping</h2>

    <p>
      Most materials in the library require models to be UV-mapped. Consider unwrapping your models for best results.
    </p>


    [anchor:relocating_textures_to_app_folder]

    <h2>Relocating Textures to App Folder</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of integrity of your application (which is important if you're transferring your project sources to a third party), you can save the textures used by appended materials in the app folder as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open the *Resource Collector* utility, then specify path to your project. Make sure that *Collect Bitmaps* is checked, also enable the *Update Materials* option. Collect your files by clicking on the *Begin* button:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-max/resource-collector.jpg" alt="Using 3ds Max Resource Collector" style="max-width: 647px">

    <p>
      You can check the integrity of your application by moving its folder to another location in your file system. Open the *max* file and make sure no errors with missing assets are generated.
    </p>
