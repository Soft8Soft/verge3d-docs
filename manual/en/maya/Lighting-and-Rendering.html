    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / Maya</h1>

    <p>
      This page contains the information about lighting, rendering and background settings which can be used with Verge3D for Maya.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D is designed to represent Maya's Viewport 2.0 hardware renderer as closely as possible. It supports physically-based shading, lights, shadows and image-based lighting (IBL).
    </p>


    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline. You can illuminate your entire scene with just an environment map alone, without using any light objects. See the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gallery/scooter-3d-product-customizer/" target="_blank">Scooter demo</a> as an example of this approach.
    </p>

    <p>The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch. To do so, simply append Arnold's *aiSkyDomeLight* object to your scene and assign some texture to it as *Color*.</p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/ai-sky-dome-light.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 892px">

    <p>In addition, you may use the *Intensity* attribute to tweak intensity of your environment lighting and *Texture Resolution* to configure its quality:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low (64x64)</strong> and <strong>Medium (128x128)</strong> - values are not supported, Verge3D will use <strong>High (256x256)</strong> setting instead of these.</li>
      <li><strong>High (256x256)</strong> - optimum quality with low memory consumption (default value).</li>
      <li><strong>Higher (512x512)</strong> - better quality with moderate memory consumption and reduced performance. Use it to render high quality reflections e.g for rendering jewelry.</li>
      <li><strong>Ultra (1024x1024)</strong> - best quality with high memory consumption and low performance (generally not recommended).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When using HDR texture for your skydome, make sure you set the *Color Space* setting to *Raw*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/ai-sky-dome-light-setup.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 458px">

    <p class="note">
      You can also *aiSkyDomeLight* without any texture to simulate light coming evenly from all directions. However, it's much more efficient to use Ambient Lights for that.
    </p>


    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
      In some cases, using just image-based lighting to illuminate your scene is not enough. If you'd like to simulate some additional light source, need dynamic shadows, or if you need to move your lights (as with car lights), you may use <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-LightingShading/files/GUID-3B4D131E-D001-4415-8BF9-250612C3A81D-htm.html" target="_blank">direct light sources</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following light types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>*Ambient Lights* - *Color* and *Intensity* attributes are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Directional Lights* - *Color* and *Intensity* attributes are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Point Lights* - *Color*, *Intensity* and *Decay Rate* attributes are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Spot Lights* - *Color*, *Intensity*, *Decay Rate*, *Cone Angle* and *Penumbra Angle* attributes are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Area Lights* — *Color*, *Intensity* attributes are supported in Verge3D. Light transform scaling controls the emissive area.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition, you can assign Depth Map Shadow Attributes on Directional, Point and Spot lights. See <a href="manual/en/maya/Shadows.html">here</a> for more info.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D add-on adds a custom light probe object called *v3dReflectionCubemap*,
      which can be used to apply indirect lighting to objects via a local
      reflection cubemap.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVSB3vFmv8M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>
      The new light probe object can be found inside the custom *Verge3D* shelf:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/light-probe-reflection-cubemap-create.png" class="centered" style="max-width: 500px">

    <p>
      This object defines a volume of influence represented by a box or a sphere.
      All objects contained inside that volume will use a local reflection
      cubemap generated in runtime instead of the scene's global environment
      texture/color.<br/><br/>

      The advantage of using a local reflection map is that it has surrounding
      objects baked in it, while the scene's global map only contains the
      background texture/color that can be specified via Arnold's
      <a href="manual/en/maya/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#environment_lighting">aiSkyDomeLight</a>
      object. Local reflection maps also have a parallax effect depending on the
      geometry of the <a href="manual/en/maya/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#influence_volume">influence</a>
      or <a href="manual/en/maya/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#parallax_volume">parallax</a>
      volume.

    <p class="note">
      Planar reflection probes can greatly reduce performance of your scene, since they multiply the number of draw calls by a factor <strong>N+1</strong>. To make rendering faster, specify a limited set of reflected objects as the *Visibility Selection Set* property.

    [anchor:background]

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      By default Verge3D renders the same background you see in Maya's Viewport (grey in most cases). When using image-based lighting (provided by *aiSkyDomeLight* objects) you see the environment texture instead.
    </p>


    <p>
      To change your background to some other color, do not edit Viewport settings in Maya, simply assign *Background Color* and enable the *Render Background* attribute on your main camera:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/render-background.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 443px">

    [anchor:ambient_occlusion]

    <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>

    <p>
      Ambient Occlusion is a rendering technique that improves a scene's realism
      by adding soft shadows from indirect (ambient) lighting based on how much
      the point is exposed to the light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D implements Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO), which settings
      you can find in the *AO* section of *Verge3D Export Settings* (accessible
      through <strong>Verge3D->Export Settings...</strong> in Maya menu):
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/ambient-occlusion-properties.png" class="centered" style="max-width: 422px">

    <p class="note">
      Verge3D adds the ambient occlusion effect only for
      <a href="manual/en/maya/Materials.html#standardSurface">Standard Sufrace</a>
      and <a href="manual/en/maya/Materials.html#aiStandardSurface">aiStandardSufrace</a>
      materials and only if the scene has environment lighting (via Arnold's
      <a href="manual/en/maya/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#environment_lighting">aiSkyDomeLight</a> object).

      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        The radius (in system units) within which to calculate ambient occlusion.
        Higher values make the effect more noticeable by over-darkening and
        expanding the area of it, but also can decrease performance. Lower
        values make occlusion less noticeable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Factor</dt>

        The strength of the occlusion effect.
      </dd>
      <dt>Trace Precision</dt>
      <dd>
        Higher precision means more accurate occlusion at increased performance

        less prominent.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bent Normals</dt>
      <dd>
        Use modified (or "bent") normals to sample the environment instead of
        the original ones. The modified normals represent the least occluded
        direction and make environment lighting a bit more realistic.
      </dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:outline_rendering]

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-example.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 819px">

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect in the *Verge3D Exports Settings*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/outline-settings.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 434px">

    <p>
      then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <p>*Enabled* — enable/disable the effect.</p>

    <p>*Edge Strength* — outlining strength factor.</p>

    <p>*Edge Glow* — intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</p>

    <p>*Edge Thickness* — outline edge thickness factor.</p>

    <p>*Pulse Period* — pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</p>

    <p>*Visible Edge Color* — visible edge color.</p>

    <p>*Hidden Edge Color* — color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</p>

    <p>*Render Hidden Edge* — enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</p>

    <p class="note">Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.</p>


    [anchor:per_object_rendering_settings]

    <h2>Per-Object Rendering Settings</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following additional rendering settings for your geometry objects:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/rendering-settings.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 454px">

    <p>
      *Render Order* - modifies the rendering order for a particular object. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered. In most cases, you need to tweak this value when using Blend transparency to eliminate transparency artifacts.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Frustum Culling* - enables/disables frustum culling optimization for the object. Uncheck this option if you have some skinned object which can move beyond the screen space to prevent it from being culled.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there is a set of object transform settings located on the *Verge3D* -> *Advanced Rendering* panel:

    [anchor:hidpi_rendering]

    <h2>Rendering on HiDPI (Retina) Screens</h2>

    <p>
      As of today, most mobile and many desktop screens have high pixel density (so called "Retina" displays). These displays allow you to substantially increase quality of your renderings. The downside of rendering many pixels is reduced performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two approaches how to make your content look better and do not make your scenes really slow:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using somewhat better resolution, e.g by setting screen scaling factor to 1.5 or so. See <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#set_screen_scale">here</a> for more info.</li>
      <li>Using HiDPI rendering only for important content, such as text, screen-space UI elements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The latter approach can be easily achieved by enabling the *HiDPI Compositing* property located on the *Advanced Rendering* panel:

    <h2>Fit to Camera Edge</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Fit to Camera Edge</em> is a technique to draw screen-space UI elements based on 3ds Max models. This approach to UI design is more “native” to the 3D artist than using HTML/CSS, and does not require external tools. But there is more in it: since the UI elements are genuine 3D objects, you can apply shaders, lighting, animation, morphing – you name it – making them truly interactive and seamlessly integrated into the scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you parent some object to the camera, the following settings appear on the *Advanced Rendering* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/fit-to-camera-edge-properties.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 423px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Horizontal</dt>
      <dd>
        Horizontal canvas edge to fit object to. *None* — no horizontal fit, *Left* — fit to left edge, *Right* — fit to right edge, *Stretch* — scale object horizontally to fit on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Vertical</dt>
      <dd>
        Vertical canvas edge to fit object to. *None* — no vertical fit, *Top* — fit to top edge, *Bottom* — fit to bottom edge, *Stretch* — scale object vertically to fit on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Shape</dt>
      <dd>
        Canvas fit shape. *Box* — use object's bounding box, *Sphere* — use object's bounding sphere to fit the object on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Fit Offset</dt>
      <dd>
        Additional offset used to fit object on the screen. Effectively, this value extends object bounding (box or sphere) by the specified absolute value.
      </dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:visibility_breakpoints]

    <h2>Visibility Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Visibility Breakpoints</em> allow you to show/hide content depending on 3D viewport width/height or orientation settings. The most important use case of this feature — adapting your scene to different screen sizes and orientations. E.g you may have two different models for portrait and landscape screen orientations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If assigned to the current camera, tries to switch to an alternative camera (must have acceptable visibility breakpoints) in the scene, if no alternative camera is found, does nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the breakpoints on the *Advanced Rendering* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/visibility-breakpoints.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 423px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Min Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Min Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Orientation</dt>
      <dd>
        Screen orientation the object stays visible.
      </dd>
    </dl>




    [anchor:clipping_planes]

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/clipping-plane-example.jpg" class="centered">

    <p>
      To add a new clipping plane, use the <strong>Verge3D -> Add a v3dClippingPlane object</strong> button located on the Maya tool shelf:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-maya/clipping-plane-new.jpg" class="centered">

    <p>
      The objects on your scene will be clipped in the negative *Y* direction of the clipping plane object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clipping planes have the following parameters:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Affected Objects</dt>
      <dd>
        Set of the objects clipped by the plane. If empty, all scene objects will be clipped.
      </dd>
      <dt>Negated</dt>
      <dd>
        Swap clipped and unclipped sides.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clip Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        Clip shadows cast from the clipped objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Union Planes</dt>
      <dd>
        Construct a union from all the clipping planes, affecting the object, not their intersection.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section</dt>
      <dd>
        Fill cross-section between the clipping plane and the affected objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Color</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section diffuse color and opacity.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Size</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section plane size. Increase this value if you use larger scene size.
      </dd>
    </dl>
