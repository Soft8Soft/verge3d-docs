    <h1>Object Constraints / Maya</h1>

    <p>
    This page contains the information about Maya's object <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-CharacterAnimation/files/GUID-7665A291-FAA7-44C0-BDEB-A6C83482116C-htm.html" target="_blank">constraints</a> which can be used with Verge3D.
    </p>

    [anchor:Constraints_and_Settings]

    <h2>Constraints and Settings</h2>

    <p>
    Below are are listed Maya object constraints that can be used with Verge3D. The parameters supported by Verge3D are overlaid with green color.
    </p>


    [anchor:parent_constraint]

    <h3>Parent</h3>

    <p>
      This is the constraint version of the standard parent/children relationship between objects.
    </p>

    [anchor:point_constraint]

    <h3>Point</h3>

    <p>
      This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to have the same location as its target.
    </p>

    [anchor:orient_constraint]

    <h3>Orient</h3>

    <p>
      This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to match the rotation of its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-maya/orient.jpg" alt="Maya orient constraint" style="max-width: 446px">



    [anchor:scale_constraint]

    <h3>Scale</h3>

    <p>
      This constraint forces the object to which it is applied to match the scale of its target.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-maya/scale.jpg" alt="Maya scale constraint" style="max-width: 446px">



    [anchor:aim_constraint]

    <h3>Aim</h3>

    <p>
      This constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it always points a given *Aim* axis towards its target, with another *Up* axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis as possible. Thus you can implement billboarding with this constraint.
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-maya/aim.jpg" alt="Maya aim constraint" style="max-width: 447px">

    <p class="note">Verge3D does support only axis-aligned *Aim* and *Up* vectors such as <strong>[1,0,0]</strong> or <strong>[0,-1,0]</strong>.</p>



    [anchor:motion_path_constraint]

    <h3>Motion Path</h3>

    <p>
      This constraint restricts an object's movement along the path (curve, shape).
    </p>

    <img src="files/constraints-maya/motion-path.jpg" alt="Maya motion path constraint" style="max-width: 575px">

    <p class="note">1. Verge3D does support only *Vector* in *World Up Type* selections.<br />2. The *follow* checkbox must always be active otherwise the constraint will not be exported.</p>



    [anchor:use_with_puzzles]

    <h2>Use with Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
      All constraints, once assigned in Maya and exported, can be removed, muted or ummuted with a <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#remove_mute_unmute_constraint">puzzle</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, *Point/Orient/Scale* constraints can be assigned at runtime with <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#limit_transform">puzzles</a>.
    </p>
