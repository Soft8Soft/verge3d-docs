    <h1>Using Material Library / Maya</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D material library is a collection of ready-to-use materials which you can assign to your Maya models. Below is the description of a recommended workflow on how to install and use these materials efficiently.

    [anchor:installing]

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>
      Material libraries are available in the Soft8Soft store in the form of themed packs:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-maya-essential-material-pack/" target="_blank">Essential Material Pack</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-maya-machinery-material-pack/" target="_blank">Machinery Material Pack</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Simply unzip the archive with a library pack to any folder on your computer. Inside this folder there are <strong>.mb</strong> files (one file per material). The textures used in the materials are located in the *material_maps* folder. The folder *environments* contains 3 variants of HDR images that you can use for the environment (each variant comes in 3 resolutions: 1k, 2k and 4k).
    </p>


    [anchor:adding_materials_to_project]

    <h2>Adding Materials to Project</h2>

    <p>
      In order to use a library material in a project, invoke the <strong>File → Import</strong> in the Hypershade editor window:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-maya/hypershade-import.jpg" alt="Import material in Hypershade editor" style="max-width: 750px">

    <p>
      Navigate to the library folder, select *mb* file, specify *Load no references* in *Load Settings*, then click *Import*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-maya/hypershade-import-no-references.jpg" alt="Maya import window">

    <p>
      Once a material is imported, you should be able to assign it to a model. Select a model, click using right mouse button, then <strong>Assign Existing Material → Name</strong>:
    </p>

    <p>
      The last step is to delete unused reference to the material library:
    </p>

    [anchor:setting_up_the_environment]

    <h2>Setting up the Environment</h2>

    <p>
      Eevee-based materials require the environment to be set up, otherwise the materials will look dark and non-reflective. The environment is already set up in Verge3D's default cube project which you can use as a basis for your own app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can configure the environment from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://youtu.be/9BzE98XIOnI" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>. You can use either of HDR textures in the *environments* folder of a material pack for this purpose.
    </p>


    [anchor:uv_mapping]

    <h2>UV Mapping</h2>

    <p>
      Most materials in the library require models to be UV-mapped. Consider unwrapping your models for best results.
    </p>


    [anchor:relocating_textures_to_app_folder]

    <h2>Relocating Textures to App Folder</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of integrity of your application (which is important if you're transferring your project sources to a third party), you can save the textures used by the imported materials in the app folder as described below.
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>
        Open the *File Path Editor* in Maya:
      </li>

      <img src="files/mat-library-maya/file-path-editor-menu.jpg" alt="Running Maya's file path editor" style="max-width: 532px">

      <li>
        Find textures which are used by the imported material. Copy these textures from the *material_maps* to the application folder:
      </li>

      <img src="files/mat-library-maya/file-path-editor.jpg" alt="Maya File Path Editor" style="max-width: 482px">

      <li>
        Select these materials in the editor, then click on the *Repath Files* button. A new dialog appears, specify *New Path* to the application directory, enable *Repath Currently Resolved Files* option, then click *Repath*:
      </li>

      <img src="files/mat-library-maya/file-path-editor-repath.jpg" alt="Repath textures in Maya" style="max-width: 414px">

    </ol>

    <p>
      You can check the integrity of your application by moving its folder to another location in your file system. Open the *mb* (or *ma*) file and make sure no errors with missing assets are generated.
    </p>
