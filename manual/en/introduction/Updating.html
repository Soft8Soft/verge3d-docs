    <h1>Updating for New Versions</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D is being actively developed with software releases occurring regularly. There is also the pre-release channel of updates with new versions coming out even more often. We recommend you to keep in pace with the development cycle and timely update your Verge3D distribution and applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Update Verge3D Installation on Windows</h2>

    <p>
      Simply download and install the latest Verge3D distribution in a folder with the same name (that is, "C:\Program Files\Verge3D_for_Blender").
    </p>

    [anchor:update_verge3d_installation_linux]

    <h2>Update Verge3D Installation on macOS/Linux</h2>

    <p>
      Backup your current Verge3D folder by renaming it (from "verge3d" to "verge3d_old", for example).
    </p>

    <p>
      Download and unpack the latest Verge3D bundle in a fresh folder with the same name (that is, "verge3d").
    </p>

    <img src="files/updating/files-backup.jpg" alt="Verge3D folder backup in file manager">

    <p>
      By using the same name for the fresh folder you can avoid re-configuring paths in the 3D editor of your choice.
    </p>

    <h2>Update Applications</h2>


    [anchor:Update_Applications_Auto]

    <h3>Method #1 (Automatic) - use the update feature</h3>

    <p>
      Simply copy the entire folder with your application to the <strong>applications</strong> folder of the fresh Verge3D installation. After launching the App Manager, your app name should appear in the list of apps (reload the page if not). Click the update button with the round arrow on it.
    </p>

    <img src="files/updating/app-manager-update-button.jpg" alt="App Manager update button" style="max-width: 801px">

    <p>
      In the window shown up, select the template files you'd like to overwrite. You can safely select everything if you didn't edit the files. If you modified the files, be sure to backup them first so that you can cherry-pick the changes back later, and only after that proceed with overwriting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the hood, this operation overwrites the engine modules by the files from the <strong>/build</strong> folder, namely, Verge3D runtime <strong>v3d.js</strong> and optional compatibility modules:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>opentype.js</strong> — enabled by the *Font Converter* checkbox in the app creation panel.</li>
      <li><strong>basis_transcoder.js/basis_transcorder.wasm</strong> — enabled by the *Texture Decompressor* checkbox in the app creation panel.</li>
      <li><strong>ammo.wasm.js/ammo.wasm.wasm</strong> — enabled by the *Physics* checkbox in the app creation panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you choose so, this operation will also overwrite the selected HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and the icons folder <strong>media</strong> by the files from the <strong>/manager/templates/template_name</strong> folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon updating, App Manager will save older versions of your files in the app's <strong>v3d_app_data/update_backup</strong> directory with a time stamp added. This allows you to restore any of the previously saved revisions of your app files when you need them. Simply copy a file back to the application folder root and remove the time stamp from its name.
    </p>


    [anchor:Update_Applications_Clean]

    <h3>Method #2 (Clean) - re-create your app from scratch</h3>

    <p>
      This is an alternative method of updating where you are in full control of your files. You can use it to get rid of obsolete files or if for some reason the automatic update method is not applicable.
    </p>

    <p>
      To perform clean updating, in the App Manager type the name of your app in the "Create new App" window and click "Create App" button.
    </p>

    <img src="files/updating/app-manager-create-new.jpg" alt="Create new app in App Manager" style="max-width: 573px">

    <p>
      Copy Blender/Max/Maya scene files, all the textures/sounds, and the Puzzles scenario file <strong>visual_logic.xml</strong> from your old app folder to the newly created app folder (located within your applications directory). Overwrite files when you're asked so. If you were using HTML-based UI in your app, copy all relevant files as well.
    </p>

    <img src="files/updating/files-copy.jpg" alt="Copying app files using file manager">

    <p>
      Finally, you should perform exporting to glTF so that the exported format receives the latest updates. If you were using Puzzles in your app, you'll need to re-save your scenario in the Puzzles editor so that the generated code matches the newest version of the engine.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you changed anything in your application's .html, .css or .js files, be sure to backup them first so that you can cherry-pick the changes back later.
    </p>


    [anchor:After_Update]

    <h2>After Update</h2>

    <h3>Re-activate your license</h3>

    <p>
      You should enter the license key each time you update to a new version, otherwise your apps may render the trial watermark when running.
    </p>


    [anchor:Known_Issues_and_Troubleshooting]

    <h2>Known Issues and Troubleshooting</h2>

    <p>
      On rare occasions the Puzzles button can disappear for your app in the App Manager. Please perform clean updating to fix this.
    </p>

    <p>
      On rare occasions the Puzzles editor may fail to load after updating. Please reset your browser settings to fix this.
