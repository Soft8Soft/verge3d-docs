    <h1>Asset Compression</h1>

    <p>
    In Verge3D, scene files may be compressed using the highly effective LZMA2 compression algorithm, thus allowing to significantly reduce the size of the files. At the same time, LZMA2 offers fast decompression on the browser side. Typical compression rates observed for Verge3D scenes are: 20x for the <strong>.gltf</strong> files and 6x for the <strong>.bin</strong> files.

    [anchor:When_Compress_Files]

    <h2>When Compress Files</h2>

    <p>
      Using asset compression is especially recommended in the following cases:
      <ul>
        <li>.gltf/.bin or .glb scene files are relatively big so that the effect from compression is significant
          in terms of size reduction;</li>
        <li>you expect slow connections and every kilobyte counts;</li>
        <li>the standard server-side GZIP compression is not enabled or not satisfactory, or
          you don't even have any access to the server to setup GZIP for Verge3D scene files.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    [anchor:Exporting_Compressed_Files]

    <h2>Exporting Compressed Files</h2>

    <p>
    Verge3D supports loading of scene files compressed in the <strong>.xz</strong> file format, which incorporates the LZMA2 compression algorithm. To enable creating <strong>.xz</strong> files automatically upon export, you can simply turn on the corresponding option in the export settings.

    [anchor:Using_Compressed_Files]

    <h2>Using Compressed Files</h2>

    <p>
      The compressed <strong>.xz</strong> files (for example, <i>my_awesome_app.gltf.xz</i> and <i>my_awesome_app.bin.xz</i>) should appear near the original ones. What is left is to enable loading them in your app. To do this, go to Puzzles...
    </p>

    <img src="files/beginners-guide-blender/app-manager-app-buttons-puzzles.jpg" alt="Button to run Puzzles logic of My Awesome App" style="max-width: 800px">

    </p>
    ...and switch to the <strong>init</strong> tab:
    </p>

    <img src="files/asset_compression/puzzles-init.jpg" alt="Init tab in Puzzles">

    <p>
      Drag out the <strong>configure application</strong> puzzle from the <strong>Initialization</strong> category, if it is not already present in the workspace, and turn on the <strong>compressed assets</strong> checkbox on it:
    </p>

    <img src="files/asset_compression/puzzles-configure-app.jpg" alt="Enable LZMA compression in configure application puzzle">

    <p>
      Finally, click the <strong>Save</strong> button. That's it!
    </p>


    [anchor:Checking_Your_Files]

    <h2>Checking Your Files</h2>

    <p>
      To ensure that your app now actually loads compressed assets, run your app (either from App Manager or from a website where it is deployed). Open the <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#browser_console">browser console</a> and switch to the <strong>Network</strong> tab.
    </p>

    <img src="files/asset_compression/console-check.jpg" alt="Checking compression in Chrome console">

    <p>
      Reload your app so that the console starts displaying files from the beginning. Find the scene files in the list - if everything is ok, they should end with <strong>.xz</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, you can check whether the compressed assets are enabled by using the <a href="manual/en/introduction/Performance-Bottlenecks.html#performance_profile">performance profile</a> feature.
    </p>


    [anchor:code_based_apps]

    <h2>Code-Based Apps</h2>

    <p>If you don't want to use Puzzles for some reason, follow these steps to enable asset compression for your apps.</p>

    <p>
      Simply change:

      <code>
        const SCENE_URL = 'my_awesome_app.gltf';
      </code>
      to:
      <code>
        const SCENE_URL = 'my_awesome_app.gltf.xz';
      </code>

      in <i>your_awesome_app.js</i> file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same applies to <strong>.glb</strong> and <strong>.glb.xz</strong> files if they are used instead of <strong>.gltf/.bin</strong>.
    </p>


    [anchor:Archivers]

    <h2>Archivers</h2>

    <p>
       Alternatively, you can create <strong>.xz</strong> files using archive utilities as
      <strong>7-Zip</strong>, <strong>XZ Utils</strong> or others.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Archiving with external tools is recomended as a time-saving measure for teams working on big projects. You might need to write some batch scripts to archive your assets in automated way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D implementation of an .xz decompressor puts some restrictions on compressed files
      due to optimization purposes, so not every .xz file can be loaded. .tar.xz files are also
      not supported. Considering this, it's recommended to use settings described below.
    </p>


    [anchor:windows]

    <h3>Windows</h3>

    <p>
      1) A popular file archiver <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-Zip</a>
      can be used for creating .xz files.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compress a file you can right click it, and then choose "7-Zip" -> "Add to archive..." - this
      opens the corresponding dialog window:
    </p>

    <img src="files/asset_compression/7zip_add_to_archive.png" alt="Compressing with 7zip" style="max-width: 630px;">

    <p>
      The archivation settings should look like this:
      <ul>
        <li>Archive format: xz</li>
        <li>Compression level: any (Normal, Maximum and Ultra give best results)</li>
        <li>Compression method: LZMA2 (the only available option)</li>
        <li>Dictionary size: up to 8 MB - the more the better (more than 8MB is
          not supported by the engine)</li>
      </ul>
      The rest of options can be left by default.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also you can use a command line version of <strong>7-Zip</strong> instead:

      <code>
        7z.exe a -m0=LZMA2:d23 scene.gltf.xz scene.gltf
7z.exe a -m0=LZMA2:d23 scene.bin.xz scene.bin
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      2) Alternatively, you can use a special command line tool called
      <strong>XZ Utils</strong>. Its Windows binaries are available
      <a href="https://tukaani.org/xz/">here</a> in the <strong>Pre-built binaries</strong> section.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usage is simple:
      <code>
        xz.exe -k -f -6 scene.gltf
xz.exe -k -f -6 scene.bin
      </code>
    </p>


    [anchor:linux]

    <h3>Linux</h3>

    <p>
      1) A <strong>7-Zip</strong> command line port can be available out of the box or
      from official repositories as a package named <strong>p7zip</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>

      The usage is similar to the one in Windows:
      <code>
        7z a -m0=LZMA2:d23 scene.gltf.xz scene.gltf
7z a -m0=LZMA2:d23 scene.bin.xz scene.bin
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      2) <strong>XZ Utils</strong> is also available out of the box or from official
      repositories in most Linux distros.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usage is similar to the one in Windows:
      <code>
        xz -k -f -6 scene.gltf
xz -k -f -6 scene.bin
      </code>
    </p>


    [anchor:macos]

    <h3>macOS</h3>

    <p>
      1) A <strong>7-Zip</strong> command line port can be installed via
      <strong>Homebrew</strong> as a package named <strong>p7zip</strong>:
      <code>
        $ brew update
$ brew install p7zip
      </code>
      The usage is the same as in Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
      2) <strong>XZ Utils</strong> binaries are available for macOS 10.5+
      <a href="https://tukaani.org/xz/">here</a> in the <strong>Pre-built binaries</strong> section.
      The usage is the same as in Linux.
