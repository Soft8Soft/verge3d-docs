    [anchor:Running_App_Manager]

    <h2>Running App Manager</h2>

    <p>
      The App Manager is implemented as website shown by the locally-run web server. This is quite similar to running an admin panel for your Wi-Fi router.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-main.jpg" alt="App Manager main screen">

    <p>
      By default, the pages are served from the address:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a> — Verge3D for Blender</li>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8669/" target="_blank">localhost:8669</a> — Verge3D for 3ds Max</li>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8670/" target="_blank">localhost:8670</a> — Verge3D for Maya</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      which you can navigate to, keep in the browser tab, or bookmark. The server itself can be launched in several ways (see below).
    </p>


    [anchor:From_Blender_Max_Maya]

    <h3>A. From Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya</h3>

    <p>
      The local web server is started automatically when you launch your 3D tool with Verge3D plug-in installed. Upon clicking on the App Manager button (Blender):
    </p>

    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-blender.jpg" alt="Running app manager from Blender" style="max-width: 951px">

    <p>or menu option (Max, Maya):</p>

    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-max.jpg" alt="Running app manager from 3ds Max" style="max-width: 951px">
    <img src="files/beginners-guide-maya/app-manager-maya.jpg" alt="Running app manager from Maya">

    <p>
      the App Manager page is shown in the default web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the web server happens to be down for some reason (e.g. you updated Verge3D to a new version), this operator also restarts it.
    </p>


    [anchor:Using_Desktop_Application]

    <h3>B. Using Desktop Application</h3>

    <p>The local web server can be launched even without running Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya. Simply click on the desktop icon created by the Verge3D installer (Windows-only). The App Manager page will be immediately shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-desktop-icon.jpg" alt="Running app manger via desktop icon">

    <p>
    If the web server is already running (e.g. you launched it from the 3D editor), this desktop application just opens the App Manager in the browser.
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Command_Line]

    <h3>C. From Command-Line</h3>

    <p>
      Install Python 3, e.g. from <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NCVDN91XZQP?hl=en-us&gl=US" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>. Once you have Python 3 installed, launch *Command Prompt* and type:
    </p>

    <code>
    cd verge3d_blender
    </code>

    <p>
      (or whatever path you installed Verge3D in), and then for Blender version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py BLENDER
    </code>

    <p>
      for Max version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAX
    </code>

    <p>
      or for Maya:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAYA
    </code>

    <p>
      Finally, open up the browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a>, <a href="http://localhost:8669/" target="_blank">localhost:8669</a>, <a href="http://localhost:8670/" target="_blank">localhost:8670</a> as usual. Users of maxOS or Linux can use the same commands, only with forward slashes.
    </p>


    [anchor:first_start]

    <h2>First Start</h2>

    <p>When Verge3D is first installed or updated to a new version, a splash screen is shown up:</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-first-start.jpg" alt="App manager splash screen" style="max-width: 600px">

    <p>
      On this screen you should select an applications folder in which your projects will be stored. You can leave the default to create a *verge3d_apps* subfolder in *Documents*. On this screen you can also switch between Light and Dark themes.
    </p>


    [anchor:Exploring_Applications]

    <h2>Exploring Applications</h2>


    [anchor:List_Main_Page]

    <h3>List on the Main Page</h3>

    <p>
      Upon starting or refreshing the main page, the App Manager scans the *applications folder* and displays all found folders as a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each application in the list, the App Manager displays all .html, .gltf/.glb and 3D editor save files (.blend, .max, .ma/.mb) found in an application folder. These files can be viewed by clicking on their icons.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files.jpg" alt="App manager item" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Application lines which contain too many files are expandable through the triangle icon near app name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files-expand.jpg" alt="App manager expanded item" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Applications can be filtered using the search field on the top.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-search.jpg" alt="App manager search" style="max-width: 800px">

      <dt>Offline Mode</dt>
      <dd>Allow your app to operate without internet connection (e.g. in airplane mode). Offline mode is implemented via special <em>service worker</em> script (<em>v3d_pwa_cache.js</em>) which automatically generated and placed into the app folder. This script is responsible for creating and maintaining a permanent cache for your app assets. The *Offline Mode* setting can be enabled and works independently of the PWA capability.</dd>
      <dt>Refresh Cache</dt>
      <dd>Once offline mode is activated for your app, the persistent app cache will be created and populated on the first launch and will be reused for all subsequent launches. Hence, it's required to refresh this cache once you made any modifications to your app (e.g. exported new scene or edited Puzzles).</dd>

    <p>
      If an application is based on an older version of Verge3D, a button for updating it becomes active in the 'operations' column on the main page:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-update-from-main.jpg" alt="Update app icon" style="max-width: 800px">

    [anchor:Whats_a_Template]

    <h3>What's a Template</h3>

    <p>
      When creating a new application, you may select a template from which the app will be created. By default, 4 templates are offered: "Standard Light", "Standard Dark", "Blank Scene", and "Code-Based".
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-explanation.jpg" alt="App templates list" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
      The source files for these templates can be found in the templates folder, e.g. "verge3d_blender\manager\templates". You can modify these files or create an entirely new template for use in your project.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
    In the templates folder, there is also a hidden template called "Embeddable"
    which you can use for creating
    <a href="manual/en/programmers_guide/Integration-with-Reactjs-Vuejs.html">React.js or Vue.js applications</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many possible ways to modify/improve your template. You can change the layout by editing HTML/CSS files, embed/use some JavaScript code or library, replace the UI elements or the preloader, or add some puzzles to be included in each new application by default.
    </p>


    [anchor:Creating_Templates]

    <h3>Creating Templates</h3>

    <p>
      In order to create your own template, click the *Settings* button on the left bar, then select *Templates* tab:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates.jpg" alt="Settings icon" style="max-width: 600px">

    <p>
      In the panel shown up, click <strong>+</strong> and specify the name for your new template (e.g. "My Template"), then click *Apply Changes*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-manage.webp" alt="Manage templates dialog" style="max-width: 702px">

    <p>
      As a result, every time you create a new application, the option to choose your template will appear:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-choose-created.webp" alt="New template on app creation dialog" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
      By default, an empty folder will be created for your application, since no files were provided for the new template. The easiest way to start with a real template is to copy some of the existing templates (e.g. "Standard Dark") and rename the copied folder according to the name of your template (that is, "My Template").
    </p>


    [anchor:managing_network_directory]

    <h2>Managing Network Directory</h2>

    <p>
      By clicking on the cloud button on the left bar, you can open the Verge3D Network directory:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-open-network.jpg" alt="Verge3D Network icon">

    <p>
      Network directory lists all files, directories, or ZIP archives you uploaded there previously:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-network-directory.jpg" alt="Verge3D Network remote files">

    <p>
      On this page you can see the size of the items as well as the date/time the assets were uploaded to the Verge3D Network (in your local timezone). For directories, date/time info corresponds to the <em>most recently uploaded</em> child element (file or another directory).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The first item ("/") shows some important info: the total size occupied by all your data, and last time something was uploaded to the Network directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can select (with checkboxes) some items and then click on the buttons located on the right panel:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>To download apps, or individual files back to your local Verge3D distro.</li>
      <li>To remove files from the directory.</li>
    </ol>

          <li>Replace the English docs by a localized version.</li>
          <li>Read docs offline and faster via URL, e.g. <em>http://localhost:8668/docs/manual/en/index.html</em></li>
          <li>Use docs for an older Verge3D version or a preview version rather than the latest stable User Manual.</li>

User experience can vary depending on a particular browser with Chromium-based ones (Google Chrome, MS Edge, Brave, etc...) benefitting the most and others like Firefox and Safari to a lesser extent.

    <dl>
      <dt>Verge3D Network cache age (minutes)</dt>
      <dd>Set the period of time after which Verge3D Network will refresh the re-uploaded application. Set this to 0 (that is, refresh instantly) for faster iterations in development. Set this for some higher value (e.g. 1440 for a day) to make your app load faster and consume less bandwidth.</dd>

      <dt>Use URL shortener for uploads</dt>
      <dd>Shorten the links to the apps uploaded to Verge3D network or generate direct (long) links. Using the direct links may be less convenient, but have the benefit of loading a bit faster. This also makes it impossible to guess about the URLs of other users' apps uploaded to Verge3D Network, which makes sense if privacy is a concern.</dd>

      <dt>Publish all app files (models, puzzles, backups, etc.)</dt>
      <dd>The <a href="manual/en/introduction/App-Manager.html#Publish">publish</a> feature will upload the files that are normally not needed for running an application online, and as such are skipped by default.

    [anchor:license_management]

    <h2>License Management</h2>

    <p>
      Use the *Key* icon in the App Manager to activate your Verge3D copy with a license key and to review your license status. When you just installed Verge3D your copy is designated as "Trial" — note the small red dot near the *Key* icon:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-key-trial.jpg" alt="Verge3D Trial">

    <p>
      Click *Enter Key* and paste your license key. This will turn your Verge3D copy to the "Active" status and the expiration date will be displayed in the resulting window:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-key-active.webp" alt="Verge3D active license">

    <p>
      Once the maintenance subscription is expired you'll be suggested to renew your license at 50% price via email. This is known as the "Grace period" and it lasts one month:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-key-grace.webp" alt="Verge3D grace period">

    <p>
      After the grace period is expired you'll be required to purchase a new license at full price. However, you can still use the older versions of Verge3D covered by your expired license.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-key-expired.webp" alt="Verge3D license expired">

    <p>
      If you're planning to use Verge3D for long time, it is optimal to take advantage of the grace period. Check your email box periodically, and watch out for the *Key* icon to see if a red dot is there:
    </p>
