    <h1>App Manager</h1>

    <p>App Manager is an easy-to-use tool for creating and performing various operations with Verge3D applications.</p>


    <h2>Contents</h2>

    [anchor:Running_App_Manager]

    <h2>Running App Manager</h2>

    <p>
      The App Manager is implemented as website shown by the locally-run web server. This is quite similar to running admin panel for your WiFi router.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-main.jpg" alt="App Manager main screen">

    <p>
    By default, the pages are served from the address <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a>, which you can navigate to, refresh or bookmark. The server can be launched in several ways (see below).
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Blender_Max_Maya]

    <h3>A. From Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya</h3>

    <p>The local web server is started automatically when you launch your 3D tool with Verge3D plug-in installed. Upon clicking on the App Manager button (Blender) or menu option (Max, Maya), the App Manager page is shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-blender.jpg" alt="Running app manager from Blender" style="max-width: 951px">
    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-max.jpg" alt="Running app manager from 3ds Max" style="max-width: 951px">
    <img src="files/beginners-guide-maya/app-manager-maya.jpg" alt="Running app manager from Maya">

    <p>
    If the web server happens to be down for some reason (e.g. you closed the first launched instance of your 3D editor), this operator also restarts it.
    </p>



    [anchor:Using_Desktop_Application]

    <h3>B. Using Desktop Application</h3>

    <p>The local web server can be launched even without running Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya. Simply click on the desktop icon created by the Verge3D installer (Windows-only). The App Manager page will be immediately shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-desktop-icon.jpg" alt="Running app manger via desktop icon">

    <p>
    If the web server is already running (e.g. you launched it from the 3D editor), this desktop application just opens the App Manager in the browser.
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Command_Line]

    <h3>C. From Command-Line</h3>

    <p>
    Install Python 3, e.g. from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>. Once you have Python 3 installed, launch *Command Prompt* and type:
    </p>

    <code>
    cd verge3d_blender
    </code>

    <p>
    (or whatever path you installed Verge3D in), and then for Blender version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py BLENDER
    </code>

    <p>
    for Max version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAX
    </code>

    <p>
    or for Maya:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAYA
    </code>

    <p>
    Finally, open up the browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a> as usual. Users of maxOS or Linux can use the same commands, only with forward slashes.
    </p>


    [anchor:first_start]

    <h2>First Start</h2>

    <p>When Verge3D is first installed or updated to a new version a splash screen is shown up:</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-first-start.jpg" alt="App manager splash screen" style="max-width: 600px">

    <p>
      On this screen you should select an applications folder in which your projects will be stored. You can leave the default path to create a subfolder in *Documents*. On this screen you can also switch between Light and Dark themes.
    </p>


    [anchor:Exploring_Applications]

    <h2>Exploring Applications</h2>


    [anchor:List_Main_Page]

    <h3>List on the Main Page</h3>

    <p>
      Upon starting or refreshing the main page, the App Manager scans the *applications folder* and displays all found folders as a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each application in the list, the App Manager displays all .html, .gltf/.glb and 3D editor save files (.blend, .max, .ma/.mb) found in an application folder. These files can be viewed by clicking on their icons.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files.jpg" alt="App manager item" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Application lines which contain too many files are expandable through the triangle icon near app name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files-expand.jpg" alt="App manager expanded item" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Applications can be filtered using the search field on the top.

    </p>



    [anchor:Templates]

    <h2>Templates</h2>


    [anchor:Whats_a_Template]

    <h3>What's a Template</h3>

    <p>
      When creating a new application, you may select a template from which the app will be created. By default, 4 templates are offered: "Standard Light", "Standard Dark", "Blank Scene", and "Code-Based".
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-explanation.jpg" alt="App templates list" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
      The source files for these templates can be found in the templates folder, e.g. "verge3d_blender\manager\templates". You can modify these files or create an entirely new template for use in your project.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
    In the templates folder, there is also a hidden template called "Embeddable"
    which you can use for creating
    <a href="manual/en/programmers_guide/Integration-with-Reactjs-Vuejs.html">React.js or Vue.js applications</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many possible ways to modify/improve your template. You can change the layout by editing HTML/CSS files, embed/use some JavaScript code or library, replace the UI elements or the preloader, or add some puzzles to be included in each new application by default.
    </p>



    [anchor:Creating_Templates]

    <h3>Creating Templates</h3>

    <p>
      In order to create your own template, click the *Settings* button on the left bar, then select *Templates* tab:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates.jpg" alt="Settings icon" style="max-width: 600px">

    <p>
      In the panel shown up, click <strong>+</strong> and specify the name for your new template (e.g. "My Template"), then click *Apply*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-manage.jpg" alt="Manage templates dialog" style="max-width: 702px">

    <p>
      As a result, every time you create a new application, the option to choose your template will appear:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-choose-created.jpg" alt="New template on app creation dialog" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
      By default, an empty folder will be created for your application, since no files were provided for the new template. The easiest way to start with a real template is to copy some of the existing templates (e.g. "Standard Dark") and rename the copied folder according to the name of your template (that is, "My Template").
    </p>


    [anchor:managing_network_directory]

    <h2>Managing Network Directory</h2>

    <p>
      By clicking on the cloud button on the left bar, you can open the Verge3D Network directory:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-open-network.jpg" alt="Verge3D Network icon">

    <p>
      Network directory lists all files, directories, or ZIP archives you uploaded there previously:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-network-directory.jpg" alt="Verge3D Network remote files">

    <p>
      On this page you can see the size of the items as well as the date/time the assets were uploaded to the Verge3D Network (in your local timezone). For directories, date/time info corresponds to the <em>most recently uploaded</em> child element (file or another directory).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The first item ("/") shows some important info: the total size occupied by all your data, and last time something was uploaded to the Network directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can select (with checkboxes) some items and then click on the buttons located on the right panel:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>To download apps, or individual files back to your local Verge3D distro.</li>
      <li>To remove files from the directory.</li>

    <h2>License Management</h2>

    <p>
      Use the *Key* icon in the App Manager to activate your Verge3D copy with a license key and to review your license status. When you just installed Verge3D your copy is designated as "Trial" — note the small red dot near the *Key* icon:
    </p>

    <p>
      Click *Enter Key* and paste your license key. This will turn your Verge3D copy to the "Active" status and the expiration date will be displayed in the resulting window:
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the maintenance subscription is expired you'll be suggested to renew your license at 50% price via email. This is known as the "Grace period" and it lasts one month:
    </p>

    <p>
      After the grace period is expired you'll be required to purchase a new license at full price. However, you can still use the older versions of Verge3D covered by your expired license.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're planning to use Verge3D for long time, it is optimal to take advantage of the grace period. Check your email box periodically, and watch out for the *Key* icon to see if a red dot is there:
