    <h1>Building HTML-Based User Interfaces for 3D Web Apps</h1>

    <p>
    Learn how you can leverage standard web technologies to create rich mobile-friendly user interfaces and website integrations.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:Introduction]

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
    The template Verge3D application offers a single-page widescreen layout with a full-screen button and a preloader. Interactive elements such as buttons can be implemented as 3D objects pinned to the camera - the same applies to text boxes.
    </p>

    <p>
    A more flexible and effective approach, however, would be to leverage the established web standards for creating user interfaces. With HTML and CSS you can build any layout for your app, making it responsive and SEO-friendly. The UI and especially text created with HTML and CSS look usually sharper than their 3D counterparts thanks to the specialized rasterisation engines of the modern web browsers. This approach will also allow you to easily mix 2D media such as images, videos and web links with WebGL content, and style your app to match the design of a website on which it will be deployed.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are plenty of web design tools ranging from the plain text editor to full-blown what-you-see-is-what-you-get website builders. The latter can produce complete sets of HTML/CSS/JavaScript ready-to-use web pages thus allowing you to never touch any code.
    </p>


    [anchor:Where_to_Add_HTML_and_CSS]

    <h2>Where to Add HTML and CSS</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose you created your application using the App Manager (with default configuration options), and named it <strong>my_awesome_app</strong>. If you look inside the *my_awesome_app* folder of your <em>applications</em> folder you'll find there <strong>my_awesome_app.html</strong> and <strong>my_awesome_app.css</strong> files that seem to be natural to start edit — but they only seem so!
    </p>

    <p>
    In practice, you might never want to edit these files as they are auto-generated by the App Manager and may get overridden as a result of an <a href="manual/en/introduction/Updating.html" target="_blank">update</a>. A more robust way to add your own HTML/CSS to a Verge3D app would be creating a <em>new</em> <strong>.html</strong> file, in which the Verge3D app <strong>.html</strong> is embedded, matryoshka-style.
    </p>


    [anchor:Quick_Overview_Teapot_Heater]

    <h2>Quick Overview: Teapot Heater</h2>

    <p>
      Check out the following example in Verge3D Asset Store — [demoLink:teapot_heater]. All the interface is built using third-party web design software and saved as <strong>index.html</strong> (this name is not obligatory). Besides interface HTML elements, the <strong>index.html</strong> file also contains an <strong>iframe</strong> element via which the Verge3D project, <strong>teapot_heater.html</strong>, is embedded.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/layered-html.jpg" alt="Two layers of HTML-based app">

    <p>
    In Verge3D App Manager such a composite project has two launching icons that you can use to independently run either the pure Verge3D project or the assembled app:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/teapot-heater-app-manager.jpg" alt="Running Teapot Heater in App Manager" style="max-width: 676px;">

    <p>
      Finally, the 2D and 3D parts are logically interconnected with <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html" target="_blank">HTML puzzles</a> to handle user events.
    </p>


    [anchor:Tutorial]

    <h2>Tutorial</h2>

    <p>
    In the following tutorial we'll show how to create a simple app with HTML-based UI. This app will have only 2 buttons for hiding and revealing the default cube.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/tutorial-final-app.jpg" alt="Basic HTML page with 2 buttons" style="max-width: 835px;">

    <p>
    We begin by creating a new project named <strong>my_awesome_app</strong> with the App Manager. Then, we will demonstrate you 2 ways of creating an additional <strong>.html</strong> file for the UI: a visual approach using a third-party webpage builder, and a code-based approach. Once the UI is ready, we'll make the HTML buttons operable with Puzzles.
    </p>



    [anchor:Designer_Approach]

    <h3>Designer Approach</h3>

    <p>
    Out of several free and paid website builders we experimented with for the purpose of using in Verge3D pipeline, we recommend <a href="https://webflow.grsm.io/3441118" target="_blank">Webflow</a> — an online editor that allows even an absolute no-coder to create UI for Verge3D apps with ease. Still, you might try other tools instead, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Google Web Designer, Tumult Hype, or Pinegrow, even though they may require some knowledge of HTML/CSS from the user.
    </p>

    <p>
    Set up a Webflow account by clicking "Get started" on their website. The required "Embed" component and the "Export Code" feature are only available to paid "Workspace plans", so you need to acquire a <a href="https://webflow.grsm.io/3441119" target="_blank">subscription</a> before proceeding with this tutorial.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-buy-account-plans.jpg" alt="Webflow plans">

    <p>
    Log in your Webflow account, go to <strong>Dashboard</strong> and click <strong>New Project</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-new-project.jpg" alt="New project button in Webflow">

    <p>
    Select <strong>Blank Site</strong> from the templates. Fill out the name of your project and click <strong>Create project</strong>:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-new-project2.jpg" alt="Creating new project in Webflow">

    <p>
    Now we embed our Verge3D app in this web page. On the left panel, click the upmost button with the "plus" icon (<strong>Add Elements</strong>). Locate the <strong>Embed</strong> component, and click on it (or drag it out):
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-iframe.jpg" alt="Adding iframe element in Webflow">

    <p>
    Copy the following line and paste it to the editor window:
    </p>

    <code>
&lt;iframe width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" src="my_awesome_app.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    </code>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-iframe2.jpg" alt="Adding iframe element in Webflow" style="max-width: 801px;">

    <p class="note">
    This line of code assumes that we will copy the web page generated by Webflow to our application folder, so that the &lt;iframe&gt; element will pick up Verge3D application's main HTML file called <b>my_awesome_app.html</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Click <strong>Save & Close</strong>. Now the <strong>Embed</strong> component is placed on the page. Ignore the 404 error notation - it'll be gone after exporting the project.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-iframe3.jpg" alt="Adding iframe element in Webflow">

    <p>
    Lets make the <strong>Embed</strong> component occupy the entire page. Click on the <strong>Style</strong> button on the top right. On the <strong>Size</strong> panel, specify <strong>100%</strong> for <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> (you'll have to click on the small <strong>PX</strong> buttons to switch from pixels to percentages). Also select <strong>Fixed</strong> for <strong>Position</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-iframe4.jpg" alt="Configuring CSS for iframe element">

    <p>
    Let's add those two buttons. Click again the <strong>Add Elements</strong> button on the most left panel, locate the <strong>Button</strong> element and drag it out to the page.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons.jpg" alt="Adding buttons in Webflow">

    <p>
    Notice that the button won't be visible right away, due to being completely covered by the previously added <strong>Embed</strong> component. To make things right, select the newly added element in the <strong>Navigator</strong> (revealed with a button on the left panel)...
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons2.jpg" alt="Adding buttons in Webflow">

    <p>
    ...and on the <strong>Style</strong> tab, select <strong>Fixed</strong> for element <strong>Position</strong> as we did for the <strong>Embed</strong> component. Also provide it with some spacing by setting top and left margins to 10 pixels each.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons3.jpg" alt="Set button style in Webflow">

    <p>
    Now the button should get visible in the top left corner of the page. Double-click on it to edit its caption and change it to "Hide".
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons4.jpg" alt="Set button caption in Webflow">

    <p>
    Add another button with the same procedure. Set its left margin to 80 pixels to make it appear near the "Hide" button and change its caption to "Show".
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons5.jpg" alt="Set button caption in Webflow">

    <p>
    Now we need to set unique <strong>IDs</strong> for both buttons - we will be using them in Puzzles. To do it, select a button, go to the <strong>Element Settings</strong> tab and type "hide_button" in the <strong>ID</strong> field. Repeat this for the second button by assigning "show_button" to its <strong>ID</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-add-buttons6.jpg" alt="Set element IDs in Webflow">

    <p>
    At this stage we can generate our UI <strong>.html</strong> file and try it with the Verge3D app. Click the angle brackets button (<strong>Export Code</strong>) on the top...
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-export-code.jpg" alt="Exort HTML code in Webflow">

    <p>
    ...then click <strong>Prepare ZIP</strong> and finally, <strong>Download ZIP</strong>:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-export-code2.jpg" alt="Prepare and download project ZIP in Webflow" style="max-width: 638px">

    <p>
    Locate the downloaded ZIP file and unpack its contents to the application folder, <strong>my_awesome_app</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/webflow-export-code3.jpg" alt="Unpack Webflow ZIP" style="max-width: 829px">

    <p>
    Run/reload Verge3D App Manager - the new <strong>.html</strong> file should be displayed as an extra blue icon.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager.jpg" alt="Running index.html file">

    <p>
    More clearly the file structure can be seen from the application page, which you can open by clicking on your application name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager-app-page.jpg" alt="Running index.html file">

    <p>
    Now run the assembled app by clicking on the <strong>index.html</strong> icon. You should see something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/tutorial-final-app.jpg" alt="Verge3D app made in Webflow" style="max-width: 835px;">

    <p>
    Let's make the HTML buttons clickable, so that the user can hide and reveal the cube. This can easily be achieved by leveraging the HTML <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#event">event</a> puzzle used in connection with the elements IDs that we assigned in Webflow. Run the Puzzles editor and add these blocks:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/html-puzzles.jpg" alt="HTML puzzles" style="max-width: 632px;">

    <p>
    Since the buttons are located in the parent <strong>.html</strong> file in which the Verge3D application is embedded, we must check the <strong>in parent doc</strong> checkbox to make them work.
    </p>

    <p>
    That's it! Save your Puzzles and run/reload the assembled app again to check if the buttons work on the cube!
    </p>

    <h2>Case #2: Google Web Designer</h2>

    <p>
    There were a video version of this tutorial on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wTXSm5mN0" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, but it is now considered outdated. Please refer to the content below for the modern version.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/webdesigner/" target="_blank">Google Web Designer</a> is a free cross-platform tool for creating web pages and web-based adverts in a visual manner. Unfortunately for 3D artists, this tool still requires some knowledge of CSS attributes which should be typed manually in the text box, and have some other issues (aka the hidden cost of freebies). Nevertheless, this tool may still be useful for creating intermediate products with simplified UI to be finalized by a web developer.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once you launched this software, select <strong>Create new file</strong>...
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-create-new.jpg">

    <p>
    ...then select <strong>HTML</strong> on the left panel and fill out all the fields: <strong>Name</strong> (e.g. "my_awesome_app_gwd"), <strong>Location</strong> (use any path, yet preferably <i>out</i> of your app folder to avoid confusion with the published version) and <strong>Title</strong> (e.g. "My Awesome App"), and click <strong>OK</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-create-new2.jpg">

    <p class="note">
    At first run, if you didn't maximize the window at startup and maximized it later, the newly created blank document may appear small. Use the *Viewport Resize* tool and drag the document corner to make it bigger or even fullscreen.
    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-viewport-resize.jpg" style="max-width: 800px">
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's start by adding the <strong>iframe</strong> element for embedding our Verge3D app's main launching file, <i>my_awesome_app.html</i>. In Google Web Designer this can be done by dragging the <strong>IFrame</strong> component out from the list under the <strong>Components</strong> tab.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-iframe.jpg">

    <p>
    After the <strong>IFrame</strong> component is placed on the page, switch to the <strong>Properties</strong> tab and make your <strong>iframe</strong> element occupy the entire page by specifying zeroes for the left and top positions and 100% for the width and height. Also, in the <strong>Source</strong> field put the path to Verge3D app main file - "my_awesome_app.html" (assuming that we'll be publishing our UI file in the root of the app folder).
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-iframe2.jpg">

    <p>
    At this stage we can generate our UI <strong>.html</strong> file and try it with the Verge3D app. Click the <strong>Publish</strong> button in the top-right corner and select <strong>Locally</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-publish.jpg">

    <p>
    In the publishing dialog select the path to the <strong>verge3d/applications</strong> folder as <strong>Location</strong>. Use the name of your application folder, <strong>my_awesome_app</strong>, in the <strong>Name</strong> field in order to save the files right in its root.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-publish2.jpg">

    <p>
    As a result, several new files will be added to your application folder, including *index.html* and some scripts.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-publish-check-files.jpg" style="max-width: 602px">

    <p>
    The new HTML file immediately starts being displayed as an extra blue icon in the App Manager. You can run it to check if it actually loads the Verge3D app.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager.jpg" style="max-width: 699px;">

    <p>
    More clearly the file structure can be seen from the application page, which you can open by clicking on your application name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager-app-page.jpg" style="max-width: 875px;">

    <p>
    Now let's add those two buttons. On the most left panel click on the <strong>Element tool</strong>, then select the <strong>Div element</strong> and start drawing a rectangle on the page.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-buttons.jpg">

    <p>
    In the <strong>Properties</strong> tab use the color picker to fill the button with color, specify its position and dimensions and most importantly, set the <strong>ID</strong> for this element which we will be using for referencing it in Puzzles.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-buttons2.jpg" style="max-width: 325px;">

    <p>
    To add a caption to the button ("Hide" or "Show"), double-click on it so that it becomes outlined in red. Click on the <strong>Text tool</strong>, then on the button and type text in the text area. Use font settings to setup the size, color and other properties. You can use the <strong>Selection tool</strong> (the first button with an arrow) to move your text field on the button.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-buttons3.jpg">

    <p>
    As a result, in the <strong>Outliner</strong> panel you should see the <strong>iframe</strong> element, 2 <strong>div</strong> elements with unique IDs assigned to them and two text elements nested inside those <strong>divs</strong>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-buttons4.jpg" style="max-width: 328px;">

    <p>
    As a finishing touch, in the CSS properties window we can make the mouse cursor turn to its "clicking" form when it is over those buttons:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/gwd-add-buttons5.jpg" style="max-width: 384px;">

    <p>
    After publishing the <i>index.html</i> file and running the assembled app from the App Manager you should see something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/tutorial-final-app.jpg" style="max-width: 835px;">

    [anchor:Developer_Approach]

    <h3>Developer Approach</h3>

    <p>
    The plain text editor is still considered by many web designers to be the most powerful and flexible tool for building web pages. Even if you are not going to dive in coding, this guide may help you understand the internal structure of a web page generated by more artist-friendly tools.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can use any text editor for editing HTML/CSS code, but it is more convenient to work if your editor supports syntax highlighting and line numbering, like Notepad++ or VS Code.
    </p>

    <p>
    A basic HTML document we can start from can look as follows. You can just copy these contents to a new text document and save as <i>index.html</i> in the <strong>verge3d/applications/my_awesome_app</strong> folder. Again, the name of the file is not obligatory and we only use it everywhere for the sake of consistency.
    </p>

    <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Index of My Awesome App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Put some description here - remember about SEO!"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>

    <p>
    Run/reload Verge3D App Manager - the new <strong>.html</strong> file should be displayed as an extra blue icon.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager.jpg" alt="HTML icon in App Manager" style="max-width: 699px;">

    <p>
    More clearly the file structure can be seen from the application page, which you can open by clicking on your application name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/my-awesome-app-manager-app-page.jpg" alt="App View in App Manager" style="max-width: 875px;">

    <p>
    Now we can add an <strong>iframe</strong> element to the document's <strong>body</strong> to embed our Verge3D app's main launching file, <i>my_awesome_app.html</i>:
    </p>

    <code>
&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;iframe id="my_iframe" src="my_awesome_app.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
    </code>

    <p>
    If you run the assembled app from the App Manager now, it will display a small embedding of the default cube application in the top-left corner. We can make it wide-screen and border-less by in-lining some CSS:
    </p>

    <code>
&lt;style&gt;
#my_iframe {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0px;
        left: 0px;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 0;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
    </code>

    <p>
    Now let's create 2 buttons by adding 2 <strong>div</strong> elements to the body, supplied with unique <strong>id</strong> attributes for referencing in CSS and in Puzzles:
    </p>

    <code>
&lt;div id="hide_button"&gt;Hide&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="show_button"&gt;Show&lt;/div&gt;
    </code>

    <p>
    You won't notice them in the app though, until you make them absolutely positioned and styled with some CSS:
    </p>

    <code>
#hide_button, #show_button {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
        height: 30px;
        background-color: DodgerBlue;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        line-height: 30px;
        cursor: pointer;
}

#hide_button {
        left: 10px;
}

#show_button {
        left: 120px;
}
    </code>

    <p>
    That's it - now you have two HTML buttons in your app! Here is the full listing of the <i>index.html</i>:
    </p>

    <code>

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Index of My Awesome App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Put some description here - remember about SEO!"&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
#my_iframe {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0px;
        left: 0px;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 0;
}

#hide_button, #show_button {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
        height: 30px;
        background-color: DodgerBlue;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        line-height: 30px;
        cursor: pointer;
}

#hide_button {
        left: 10px;
}

#show_button {
        left: 120px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;iframe id="my_iframe" src="my_awesome_app.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        &lt;div id="hide_button"&gt;Hide&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="show_button"&gt;Show&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>

    <p>
    When running the assembled app from the App Manager you should see something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/tutorial-final-app.jpg" alt="Running Verge3D app with HTML" style="max-width: 835px;">

    <p>
    Let's make the HTML buttons clickable, so that the user can hide and reveal the cube. This can easily be achieved by leveraging the HTML <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#event">event</a> puzzle used in connection with the elements IDs that we assigned in Webflow. Run the Puzzles editor and add these blocks:
    </p>

    <img src="files/HTML-based-user-interfaces/html-puzzles.jpg" alt="Handling events in Verge3D" style="max-width: 632px;">

    <p>
    Since the buttons are located in the parent <strong>.html</strong> file in which the Verge3D application is embedded, we must check the <strong>in parent doc</strong> checkbox to make them work.
    </p>

    <p>
    That's it! Save your Puzzles and run/reload the assembled app again to check if the buttons work on the cube!
