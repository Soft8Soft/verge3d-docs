    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p>Below we answer some common questions about Verge3D and related topics.</p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:Licensing]

    <h2>Licensing and Support</h2>


    [anchor:download_purchased]

    <h3>I purchased Verge3D. How do I download the watermark-free version?</h3>

    <p>
    After purchase (in minutes or hours depending on your time zone) you will be sent an email with your license key. Copy this key and paste it in the App Manager's *License Information* panel. This will make your Verge3D trial bundle a licensed copy and will remove the watermark from your projects.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, if you purchased the Enterprise version, you can download the special DevKit distribution containing the source code of Verge3D. To get it, go to your <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/my-account/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> at soft8soft.com and click *Downloads* button. The same applies to all material packs purchased from Soft8Soft.
    </p>

    [anchor:how_many_computers]

    <h3>On how many computers can Verge3D be installed? How many users can use a single license?</h3>

    <p>
      The license is assigned on the per person (Freelance) or per entity (Team, Enterprise) basis. The number of installations is not limited. In case of the Freelance option, only one individual can use Verge3D. On the other hand, there can be up to 5 developers who can use Verge3D within a company or organization.
    </p>

    [anchor:trial]

    <h3>What are the limitations / restrictions of the Verge3D Trial? Can I do ... ?</h3>

    <p>The trial version is intended for evaluation purposes only. You must not use in production environments, either for commercial or non-commercial purposes.</span></p>

    <p>So, you can practice you skills with the trial version. You can create a mock-up presentation for your managers. You cannot use it for education - <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/contact/" target="_blank">reach us</a> to request a special Educational license at reduced price. And you cannot build up your portfolio with the trial as this qualifies as production use - be sure to purchase the Verge3D Freelance license for that.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d-trial/" target="_blank">this page</a> for more info about benefits and limitations of the Verge3D Trial version.</p>

    [anchor:tech_support]

    <h3>How do I obtain technical support?</h3>

    <p>
      We offer technical support services as part of the Verge3D Enterprise <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product-category/enterprise-licenses/" target="_blank">packages</a>.

    [anchor:General_Questions]

    <h2>General Questions</h2>

    [anchor:what_is_webgl]

    <h3>What is WebGL?</h3>

    <p>
      WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a technology for rendering interactive 3D graphics within the browser. WebGL works right on a website (whether it is accessed from a desktop or smartphone) without installing additional software. However, this is a geeky tech and it would require a lot of time and expertise even to just render a rotating cube. By hiding all this complicated stuff, Verge3D allows a non-coder — an artist, an engineer, or an educator to create rich web-based interactives with ease.
    </p>


    [anchor:what_is_client_server]

    <h3>What is client-side, server-side?</h3>

    <p>
      In the context of web development, client-side means that something happens in the browser running on the user's device. Server-side means that something happens on the web server.
    </p>

    <img src="files/faq/client-server.svg" alt="Basic client-server model" style="max-width: 700px">

    <p>
      If we say that Verge3D is a client-side solution, that means that your 3D app works in the browser and there is no server-side programming or additional frameworks required to get your app up and running. This is a key feature of Verge3D that makes it so easy to use. However, since we're talking about web development, the existence of some basic server functionality is implied. In most cases, this functionality is limited to serving application files to the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make your live easier, we don't require you to have any knowledge about server-side stuff at all. That's why we implemented 3 server-side solutions in Verge3D:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>*App Manager* provides a server that allows you to launch applications and use the Sneak Peek feature on your local PC.</li>
      <li>*Verge3D Network* is a cloud-based server that can be used to distribute apps to your users with just a single click.</li>
      <li>*Verge3D for WordPress* is a plugin used to host Verge3D applications on WordPress, the most popular and easy-to-use content management system.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Of course, you are not limited to use these three! You can always power up your own web server, such as Apache, NGINX, IIS, or use some third-party hosting platform, such as Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, or GoDaddy.
    </p>


    [anchor:roadmap]

    <h3>Where can I find the roadmap for Verge3D development?</h3>

    <p>Verge3D is a client-oriented product so we move in the direction our customers <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/forum/bug-reports-and-feature-requests/" target="_blank">want us to</a>. In general, our priorities are e-commerce, e-learning, and AR/VR applications. If you have a specific feature in mind that you'd like to see in Verge3D, we can add it on a contract basis. Feel free to <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/contact/" target="_blank">reach us</a> to discuss details.</p>

    [anchor:internet_connection]

    <h3>Do I need Internet connection to work with Verge3D?</h3>

    <p>
      Verge3D toolkit is installed on your local computer and does not require internet connection to operate. The only feature that requires Internet connection is publishing finished apps on <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d-network/">Verge3D Network</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, to help users with unstable or low-band internet connection, we ship offline versions of Verge3D User Manual and Developer Reference. Find these in the *docs* directory of your Verge3D distribution.
    </p>

    [anchor:app_browser_security]

    <h3>My app does not load when I open it in Chrome - yet it works when running from the App Manager...</h3>

    <p>
      Due to security policy imposed by browser vendors, web applications cannot access data loaded from another domain, including from a local file system (with Firefox being an exception here). Therefore, you should use the App Manager (which comes with a local server) for development, or publish your Verge3D apps on a web server (or upload to the Verge3D Network) to be able to run it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a desktop or mobile application instead, you can convert your Verge3D apps to those platforms using the App Manager. See the following guides on how to create <a href="manual/en/introduction/Creating-Desktop-Apps.html">desktop</a> or <a href="manual/en/introduction/Creating-Mobile-Apps.html">mobile</a> apps with Verge3D.
    </p>


    [anchor:app_double_click]

    <h3>Cannot load app when I launch it by clicking on the .html file.</h3>

    <p>See the answer on the question <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#app_browser_security">above</a>.</p>

    [anchor:standalone_html]

    <h3>Can I export my scene to a standalone all-in HTML file?</h3>

    <p>
    Nope, there is no all-in HTML format offered by Verge3D. If you need a standalone executable you can try to convert it with <a href="manual/en/introduction/Creating-Desktop-Apps.html">Electron</a>.
    </p>

    [anchor:ie11]

    <h3>Do Verge3D apps work in Internet Explorer 11?</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, older versions of Verge3D (prior to 4.0) come with the *IE 11* compatibility module:
    </p>

    [anchor:app_manager_standalone]

    <h3>Is it possible to run the App Manager without Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya?</h3>

    <p>
      Sure, you can run the App Manager in standalone mode. Simply click on the corresponding <em>Verge3D</em> icon from the desktop or start menu. This launcher will also open your default browser and automatically navigate to the App Manager.
    </p>

    </dl>

    [anchor:app_failed_to_load_on_remote]

    <h3>App works fine in the App Manager but fails when uploaded to a remote server (such as Verge3D Network)</h3>

    <p>
      Possible reasons for that:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Your development system is case insensitive, while the remote system is case sensitive.</li>
      <li>You incorrectly specified the absolute path to the HTML or glTF file.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Example for the first case: if you're using Windows or macOS (both are <em>case insensitive</em> file systems), you can accidentally rename your files when exporting. Since the most Linux servers (including Verge3D Network) use <em>case sensitive</em> file system this may cause the issue when the file uploaded to the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you created the "MyConfigurator" app. By default, this app will include the following asset files in it:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
MyConfigurator.blend (or MyConfigurator.max or MyConfigurator.mb)
MyConfigurator.html
MyConfigurator.js
MyConfigurator.css
MyConfigurator.gltf
MyConfigurator.bin
    </code>

    <p>
      Say you open your scene file in Blender/Max/Maya and export it as <strong>myconfigurator.gltf</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This way your app folder will look as follows (check the case of the two bottom lines):
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
MyConfigurator.blend (or MyConfigurator.max or MyConfigurator.mb)
MyConfigurator.html
MyConfigurator.js
MyConfigurator.css
myconfigurator.gltf
myconfigurator.bin
    </code>

    <p>
      If you open your app main JS file (MyConfigurator.js in our example), you can see that it tries to load <strong>MyConfigurator.gltf</strong>, not <strong>myconfigurator.gltf</strong>. This is perfectly fine on Windows/macOS, since these two names represent the same file! However, when you upload your app to the server, it will fail to load.
    </p>

    <p>
      As such, always save and export your files with proper case. Alternatively, you can rename your file in the main JS file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second situation, you might incorrectly specified <em>absolute</em> path to the loaded resource, such as:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
      /applications/my_awesome_app/my_awesome_app.gltf
    </code>

    <p>or</p>

    <code class="language-html">
      http://localhost:8668/applications/my_awesome_app/my_awesome_app.gltf
    </code>

    <p>
      In such case, specify <em>relative</em> path to fix the issue:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
      my_awesome_app.gltf
    </code>

    <p>or</p>

    <code class="language-html">
      ./my_awesome_app.gltf
    </code>


    [anchor:renaming_app]

    <h3>How to rename my application properly?</h3>

    <p>
      Go to the *applications* directory located in your Verge3D installation, find and rename directory which contains your app (e.g *my_awesome_app* to *cool_3d_visualization*).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Please note, that the app name is not the title displayed in the App Manager! For example, "my_awesome_app" app gets the "My Awesome App" title. This title is generated automatically by replacing underscore characters with spaces and placing initial characters of the words to upper case.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you also want to rename the files <em>inside</em> your app, do the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to the app directory.</li>
      <li>
        Assign new names to all html/css/js/gltf/bin/blend/max/ma/mb assets (see more <a href="manual/en/introduction/Project-Structure.html">here</a>). Do not touch *v3d.js*, *visual_logic.xml*, and *visual_logic.js* scripts!
      </li>
      <li>Open and reexport your scene(s) to update paths inside exported glTF assets.</li>
      <li>
        Open the main HTML file (e.g *my_awesome_app.html*) and update the following JS/CSS paths:
        <code>
&lt;script src=&quot;my_awesome_app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;my_awesome_app.css&quot;&gt;
        </code>

        Say you want to rename *my_awesome_app* to *cool_3d_visualization*. In this case, the paths become:
        <code>
&lt;script src=&quot;cool_3d_visualization.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;cool_3d_visualization.css&quot;&gt;
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the main JavaScript file (e.g *my_awesome_app.js*) and update the following line with the preferred application name:
        <code>
          var sceneURL = params.load ? params.load : '__URL__my_awesome_app.gltf'.replace('__URL__', '');
        </code>

        Say you want to rename *my_awesome_app* to *cool_3d_visualization*. In this case, the sceneURL line becomes:
        <code>
          var sceneURL = params.load ? params.load : '__URL__cool_3d_visualization.gltf'.replace('__URL__', '');
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Launch the app in the App Manager. If the app does not work, open the <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#browser_console">browser console</a> to check for possible errors.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Also, feel free to update the HTML metadata in the renamed app. See <a href="manual/en/introduction/Personalizing-Verge3D-Apps.html#title_description">here</a> for more info on how to do that.
    </p>


    [anchor:Modelling]

    <h2>Modelling and Content Creation</h2>

    [anchor:what_is_gltf]

    <h3>What is glTF?</h3>

    <p>glTF is a universal web-friendly file format which is used to store and interchange 3D graphics data in Verge3D and other 3D software. It can store not just models but entire scenes, including geometry data (meshes), object positions, animations, camera data, lights, materials, textures and other info.</p>

    <p>The glTF format specifies only a basic set of features. Thus, we extended this format with several extensions (prefixed S8S). Verge3D's subset of glTF supports not only the basic PBR materials, but also Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya node-based materials, cameras, lights, environment and other things, making your asset workflow easier and more efficient.</p>

    <p class="note">
      In Verge3D we use the 2.0 version of the glTF format. Using the older 1.0 version is not recommended.
    </p>


    [anchor:gltf_materials]

    <h3>In what cases should I use glTF-compatible materials?</h3>

    <p>There are some benefits in using <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#materials" target="_blank">glTF-compatible</a> PBR materials over Blender, 3ds Max or Maya native node-based system:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In many cases, glTF materials work faster, making them a good choice for low-end devices.</li>
      <li>The shaders are compiled quicker thus speeding up the application startup.</li>
      <li>Thanks to their simplicity, glTF-compatible materials are much easier to create. They are also supported natively in the popular material designers such as Substance Painter.</li>
      <li>You can export them into glTF 2.0 format with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Scenes.html#export_to_gltf">export to gltf</a> puzzle and preview/load in a great variety of model viewers.</li>
      <li>You can export them into USDZ with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Scenes.html#export_to_usdz">export to usdz</a> puzzle and preview on Apple devices in AR mode.</li>
      <li>Last but not least, these materials will work properly in other software which supports assets in glTF format.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The main drawback of using glTF-compliant materials is that you can't use the native material system provided by the modelling suite. As such, it might be difficult to achieve the same level of quality for your renderings.</p>

    <p>Check out the following guides for more info:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="manual/en/blender/GLTF-Materials.html">Creating glTF-compatible materials in Blender</a></li>
      <li><a href="manual/en/max/GLTF-Materials.html">Creating glTF-compatible materials in 3ds Max</a></li>
      <li><a href="manual/en/maya/GLTF-Materials.html">Creating glTF-compatible materials in Maya</a></li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:gltf_or_glb]

    <h3>Which 3D format is better glTF or GLB?</h3>

    <p>These are the two variations of the same glTF 2.0 format. glTF container is more popular and more efficient since it stores only metadata (parameters of your scenes/objects/materials etc). All external data, such as geometry, animation and textures are stored separately (in *.bin, *.jpeg, *.png files).</p>
    <p>The GLB container stores all data in the binary form and packs metadata, geometry, animation and textures into one big file. As such, GLB can be is more convenient since you don't need to deal with a bunch of files.</p>


    [anchor:black_rendering]

    <h3>When I export my scene to Verge3D I see nothing (or just the background).</h3>

    <p>This may happen due to various reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>You camera is not configured properly. Check out its <em>near</em> and <em>far</em> clipping distances as well as the target point (if your camera has the <em>Orbit</em> controls type).</li>
      <li>This could be <em>backface culling</em> or normals pointing in wrong direction. Check your materials and normals.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it can be an issue with your hardware or a software bug preventing geometry to be rendered. Check out the <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#browser_console">browser console</a> and see if there any errors reported.</li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:supported_3d_formats]

    <h3>What 3D formats can be used with Verge3D?</h3>

    <p>
    Verge3D is able to load various formats including glTF, OBJ, FBX, COLLADA, STL and PLY. Still, the preferred way to create 3D web content is to use glTF 2.0 format which is supported by Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya exporters.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, the script of the Standard application template is based on the [page:App] class which supports loading glTF files only. For loading other formats, use the corresponding <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/api/en/index.html" target="_blank">loaders</a> instead.
    </p>


    [anchor:is_maya_lt_supported]

    <h3>Is Maya LT or Maya Creative supported?</h3>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, no. Maya LT does not support Python scripting for some reason and as such exporting from it is not possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Same thing with Maya Creative, as it does not allow loading any third-party plugins.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I convert my SolidWorks model to WebGL using your software?</h3>

    <p>As of 2016 version, 3ds Max supports SolidWorks assets natively. Simply <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-861F1B25-0F1B-4E79-A660-821F4CD2175B" target="_blank">import your SolidWorks file</a> into 3ds Max and then export to WebGL as any other Max scene.</p>
    <p>Note: Pay attention to geometry optimization since CAD models tend to be quite heavy for the web. Tweak *Mesh Resolution* setting from the *Import Settings* dialog when importing your files. You can also use 3ds Max modifiers to reduce the number of polygons on your models.</p>

    <h3>What would be the most straightforward way to create 3D configurators with Verge3D, considering I have very limited skills in web development?</h3>

    <p>
      If so, we'd recommend taking one of the demos shipped with Verge3D as a reference, then modifying it for your needs. The following 3 demos in our Asset Store were made by 3D artists alone, without a single line of code written:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Ring</dt>
      <dd>The easiest, UI is based on camera-parented objects.</dd>
      <dt>Recliner</dt>
      <dd>Comes with more advanced HTML-based layout and shopping cart made with Webflow editor.</dd>
      <dt>Scooter</dt>
      <dd>Most advanced, 1000000+ combinations. Similarly to Recliner, UI was made with Webflow editor.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Also, if you manage to use WordPress CMS, pay attention to <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html#woocommerce">WooCommerce Composite Products</a> extension which can help you to build Verge3D-friendly 3D web configurators with ease.

    <h3>My budget is limited, but I still want to create a 3D-enabled web store. How do I proceed?</h3>

    <p>
      At first, you create 3D visualizations for your products. Then you have 3 options:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>PayPal. You can add PayPal payments to your app with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#paypal_create_order">paypal create order</a> puzzle, then upload to Verge3D Network or some other hosting. This option would be the easiest.</li>
      <li>WooCoommerce, an e-commerce platform used by millions online shops. This option is free and runs on top of WordPress. Use Verge3D plugin for WordPress to upload 3D content, then <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html#woocommerce">setup it</a> to work with WooCommerce.</li>
      <li>Custom e-commerce website provided by Verge3D plugin for WordPress. The orders are processed by using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order">place order</a> or <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order_adv">place order +</a> puzzles. Similarly to WooCommerce option, it requires a web server or hosting platform running WordPress.</li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:setup_cpq_system]

    <h3>I need to create a basic CPQ (configure price quote) system with customizable products shown in 3D.</h3>

    <p>
      We'd recommend the following approach:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The 3D part can be designed as regular Verge3D application. <em>Configuration</em> engine is implemented with Puzzles (see any Verge3D configurator demo). If you have many models to load them at once, you should split your content to multiple assets and use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Scenes.html#append_scene">append scene</a> puzzle to load the models on demand.
      </li>

      <li>
        The <em>prices</em> can be calculated with Puzzles (client-side, which is not secure) or better handled on the server if security is a concern. If you choose the server approach, add all product parts and their corresponding prices in the admin interface of the <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html">Verge3D for WordPress</a> plugin, then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order_adv">place order +</a> puzzle in your app to generate orders.
      </li>

      <li>
        Verge3D plugin for WordPress comes with customizable document generator which can be used to create both <em>quotes</em> and <em>invoices</em>. These documents can be downloaded by the sales manager or emailed to the customers, either manually or automatically.
      </li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:custom_firstperson_controls_on_mobile]

    <h3>How to make custom first-person controls on mobile devices?</h3>

    <p>
      Basically, you need to make additional screen-aligned elements which will be your FPS character controls. Minimum set of such elements would be forward-backward (since rotation is performed by touching/dragging the screen).
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, you have two ways to render FPS controls on a mobile device:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>By using HTML elements positioned above the rendered 3D scene. See more about this technique <a href="manual/en/introduction/HTML-based-user-interfaces.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>By using planes or similar 3D objects parented to the camera. For that, you just need to parent and align these in the modelling suit.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Once you have your screen controls created, use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#change_local_transform">change local transform</a> to move your camera. For example, to move forward/backward you can use the following logic:
    </p>

    <img src="files/faq/fps-move-puzzles.jpg" alt="Puzzles to move forward-backwards">

    <p class="note">
      To implement character strafing use the same puzzle but move along *X* axis instead of *Z*.
    </p>


    [anchor:hide_show_annotations]

    <h3>Why hide/show puzzles do not work for annotations?</h3>

    <p>
      Since Verge3D moves and controls visibility of the annotation objects itself, hide/show puzzles won't work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, you should use the *display* CSS property for the annotation element referenced by its ID. For example, to hide/show annotation with the element ID *poi1*, you can use the following two puzzles:
    </p>

    <img src="files/faq/hide-show-annotations.jpg" alt="Puzzles to show/hide annotations" style="max-width: 628px">

    <p>
      Basically, setting *display* to *none* hides an annotation, while setting *display* back to *block* shows it.
    </p>

    <h2>Advanced Programming Questions</h2>

    <p>Read below if you have some JavaScript coding skills.</p>


    [anchor:threejs_compatibility]

    <h3>Is Verge3D compatible with Three.js API?</h3>

    <p>
      Verge3D offers limited compatibility with Three.js API, as such existing Three.js code can ported to Verge3D with minimal efforts. However, you don't really need to rely on programming to do things. Properly setting up the scene in the 3D modelling suite as well as using Puzzles can cover the most use cases.
    </p>


    [anchor:texture_memory_usage]

    <h3>How to calculate texture memory usage?</h3>

    <p>To store a regular (non-HDR) texture in the GPU memory, you will require at least</p>

    <code>width x height x 4 x 1.333 bytes</code>

    <p>Where *width*, *height* are the texture dimensions in pixels, *4* is the number of bytes per pixel, while *1.333* represent additional memory needed for texture mipmapping. For example, a texture of size 2048x2048 will occupy approximately 22.4 Mb of GPU memory. If you need to store an HDR texture, multiply that value by *2*.</p>

    <p>Also, depending on WebGL implementation, the browsers may store at least one copy of the texture in the conventional (system) memory.</p>


    [anchor:preserve_scale_on_resize]

    <h3>How can scene scale be preserved on resize?</h3>

    <p>
      We want all objects, regardless of their distance from the camera, to appear the same size, even as the window is resized.

      The key equation to solving this is this formula for the visible height at a given distance:

      <code>
        visible_height = 2 * Math.tan((Math.PI / 180) * camera.fov / 2) * distance_from_camera;
      </code>
      If we increase the window height by a certain percentage, then what we want is the visible height at all distances
      to increase by the same percentage.

      This can not be done by changing the camera position. Instead you have to change the camera field-of-view.

    [anchor:app_endless_growing_ios]

    <h3>My app window grows endlessly on iOS devices. How to fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <p>
        If you embed a Verge3D application inside an iframe element, you may run
        into a specific issue on iOS devices, which causes iframes to constantly
        increase in size beyond the boundaries of the browser window. This in turn
        can lead to a WebGL crash.
      </p>

      <p>
        To deal with this issue you can use the following snippet, which resizes
        the iframe to the page's body preventing the said iframe from extending
        beyond it.
      </p>

      <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
    if (/(iPad|iPhone|iPod)/g.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
        function resize() {
            iframe.style.width = getComputedStyle(document.body).width;
            iframe.style.height = getComputedStyle(document.body).height;
            iframe.setAttribute('scrolling', 'no');
        }
        iframe.addEventListener('resize', function(e) {
            resize();
        });

        resize();
    }
    &lt;/script&gt;
      </code>
    </p>


    [anchor:keyboard_not_working]

    <h3>Keyboard controls does not work for the app embedded in iframe.</h3>
    <p>
      It happens when some other HTML on your page gets the focus. To fix this issue try the following code:
      <code>
        document.getElementById("my_iframe_id").focus();
      </code>
      Where <strong>my_iframe_id</strong> is the ID of your iframe element.
