    <h1>Testing Verge3D Applications on Mobile Browsers</h1>

    <p>
      When you launch a Verge3D application from the App Manager, it runs on top of local development server using the *localhost* address. This address can only be used on your local machine. In order to test how your app works on a mobile device's browser, you can use one of the following procedures.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:IP_Address]

    <h2>Method #1: Local IP Address</h2>

    <p>
      Click the gear icon on the left bar of the App Manager and in the *General* settings turn on *Enable external server interface*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/app-manager-settings-external-server-interface.webp" alt="Enable external server interface in App Manager" style="max-width: 702px">

    <p>
      Open App Manager settings again, the *Local network address* should appear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you can use the provided IP address in your local Wi-Fi or Ethernet network instead of *localhost*. Launch the App Manager on a mobile device's web browser by navigating to the network address, for example:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
      http://192.168.2.3:8668/
    </code>

    <p>
      Finally, run your apps on mobile as usual - by tapping blue icons in the App Manager.
    </p>


    [anchor:IP_Address_QR_Code]

    <h2>Method #2: Local IP Address + QR Code</h2>

    <p>
      This is a variation of method #1. Instead of running the App Manager and then an application on a mobile device's browser, you can launch the application <i>on your computer</i> via the App Manager using the network address.
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
      http://192.168.2.3:8668/
    </code>

    <p>
      A link to the application can be conveniently opened on mobile using a QR code. To generate such QR codes, use the sharing feature of the Google Chrome browser (also available in Microsoft Edge):
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/chrome-generate-qr-code.png" alt="Generating QR codes in Chrome browser">

    <p>
      For other browsers you should use QR generator extensions for the same purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The obtained QR code can be scanned with a mobile device's camera (by using the built-in <em>camera</em> app) thus opening the link on a mobile browser.
    </p>

    [anchor:Port_Forwarding]

    <h2>Method #3: Port Forwarding</h2>

    <p>
      This method will work for Android devices. With a USB cable and Chrome DevTools, you can launch the App Manager right from your mobile device's browser by navigating to <i>localhost:8668</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike methods 1-2, this method is suitable for launching AR/VR applications, as localhost does not require a secure connection between the mobile browser and the workstation. In addition, you'll be able to see the output of the mobile browser's console.
    </p>

    <p>
      On an Android device, go to <strong>Settings → Developer options</strong> and enable *USB debugging*.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      By default, the developer options in Android devices are hidden. You can unlock them by locating the Build number in your Settings menu and tapping it multiple times.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/android-developer-options.jpg" alt="Debugging Android devices in Chrome" style="max-width: 360px">

    <p>
      Connect your Android device with a USB cable. In Chrome browser on your computer, navigate to <i>chrome://inspect</i>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/chrome-inspect.jpg" alt="Chrome Inspect page" style="max-width: 670px">

    <p>
      This should show a dialog popup on your Android device - if not, reload the <i>chrome://inspect</i> or re-insert the USB cable. In the popup, allow USB debugging by tapping OK.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/android-usb-debugging.jpg" alt="Allow USB debugging popup dialog" style="max-width: 360px">

    <p>
      You now should see your Android device on the <i>chrome://inspect</i> page. Also, if you open Chrome on your mobile device, it should be listed there.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/chrome-inspect2.jpg" alt="Device shown in Chrome Inspect" style="max-width: 670px">

    <p>
      Click *Port forwarding* button on the <i>chrome://inspect</i> page. In the shown-up window: in *Port* field, type <i>8668</i>, in *IP address and port* field, type <i>localhost:8668</i>. Click *Enable port forwarding* and close the window with *Done* button.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/chrome-port-forwarding.jpg" alt="Enabling port forwarding in Chrome" style="max-width: 911px">

    <p>
      The <i>chrome://inspect</i> page should display a green indicator for port forwarding near the device.
    </p>

    <img src="files/testing-mobile-browsers/chrome-port-forwarding2.jpg" alt="Testing port forwarding in Chrome" style="max-width: 707px">

    <p>
      As a result, you should be able to launch the App Manager right from your mobile device's browser by navigating to <i>localhost:8668</i>. In addition, you can see the output of the mobile browser's console by clicking *inspect* link on the <i>chrome://inspect</i> page.
