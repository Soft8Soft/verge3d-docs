    <h1>WordPress Plugin</h1>

    <p>
      Verge3D comes with a plugin for WordPress, the most popular content management system (CMS) in use (60+ million installations).
    </p>

    <p>Verge3D for WordPress plugin offers the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WebGL application hosting and embedding (direct, via iframe, or shortcode).</li>
      <li>An easy-to-use widget for Elementor.</li>
      <li>Integration with WooCommerce system. You can embed Verge3D applications into product pages and make powerful 3D configurators with Puzzles.</li>
      <li>Proprietary e-commerce system alternative to WooCommerce.</li>
      <li>Persistent file storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These features can work independently on each other. For example, you might want just the embedding, or you can handle orders received from a Verge3D application hosted somewhere else (such as on Verge3D Network etc).
    </p>

    <h2>Plugin Sandbox</h2>

    <p>
      To try out the features of the plugin please check out the <a href="https://sandbox.soft8soft.com" target="_blank">Verge3D for WordPress sandbox</a>. It provides a safe environment that you can use to test your Verge3D apps.
    </p>


    [anchor:installation]

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      Before installing the plugin, make sure you have at least WordPress 5.0. To upload applications on your server you need to have a modern browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari.
    </p>

    <p>
      To install, simply:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Click <strong>Add New</strong> on the Plugins settings page from your WordPress admin dashboard.</li>
      <li>Find the Verge3D plugin in the official WordPress.org <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/verge3d/" target="_blank">repository</a> and install it.</li>
      <li>Activate the plugin. <strong>Verge3D</strong> menu should appear in the admin panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In some cases, you might need to install the plugin from the Verge3D distribution (for example, when you're going  to try a new feature available in the pre-release version of Verge3D). To do so, follow these steps:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Upload the plugin archive from <em>verge3d/wordpress/verge3d.zip</em> via WordPress admin interface.</li>
      <li>Activate the plugin in the *Plugins* menu. *Verge3D* menu should appear in the admin panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      After activation, try to upload some of your apps or create a test order to verify that plugin works as expected.
    </p>


    [anchor:uploading_applications]

    <h2>Uploading Applications</h2>

    <p>
      Use the <strong>Applications</strong> admin menu to access <strong>Verge3D Applications</strong> screen:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/app.png" alt="Verge3D for WordPress applications">

    <p>
      To upload new app, click *Add New* button, enter app name, then click *Next*. You'll see *Manage Verge3D Application* dialog. Click *Choose Files*, select an application folder, then click *Upload*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/upload-app.jpg" alt="Uploading Verge3D app to WordPress">

    <p>
      On this form you can also configure iframe (canvas) size of your application and allow/deny fullscreen mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      To embed Verge3D applications in your WordPress pages/posts use the following shortcode:
    </p>

    <code>[verge3d id="YOUR_APP_ID"]</code>

    <p>
      where <em>YOUR_APP_ID</em> is an ID of your application displayed in the table on the <strong>Verge3D Application</strong> screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use the Elementor plug-in, there is a <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html#elementor_widget">widget</a> which can make the things even simpler.
    </p>


    [anchor:application_settings]

    <h2>Application Settings</h2>

    <p>
      On the *Manage Verge3D Application* screen you can find the following settings:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/app-settings.webp" alt="3D app settings">

    <dl>
      <dt>Title</dt>
      <dd>Application name. This value is used in WordPress admin interface only, e.g. to attach a Verge3D app to WooCommerce product page. In order to specify app title shown in the browser (or Google/Bing search) you need to edit the app HTML. Check out the <a href="manual/en/introduction/Personalizing-Verge3D-Apps.html#title_description">following section</a> to find out how to do this.</dd>
      <dt>iframe width</dt>
      <dd>Width of the app canvas embedded in WordPress pages/posts/product pages (in pixels). Please note that the actual size can be affected by WordPress theme, layout, custom CSS code, etc.</dd>
      <dt>iframe height</dt>
      <dd>Height of the app canvas embedded in WordPress pages/posts/product pages (in pixels). Please note that the actual size can be affected by WordPress theme, layout, custom CSS code, etc.</dd>
      <dt>Allow fullscreen mode</dt>
      <dd>Allow/deny fullscreen mode. If unchecked, the app fullscreen button will be removed making it impossible to enter fullscreeen mode.</dd>
      <dt>Allow AR/VR</dt>
      <dd>Allow/deny AR/VR sessions for the app.</dd>
      <dt>Loading</dt>
      <dd>Loading strategy for the application. Set it to *Lazy* to defer loading when the app is off-screen. Use *Eager* to force the browser to load it immediately. *Auto* means the browser itself decides when to load the app.</dd>
      <dt>App Image</dt>
      <dd>Application image. This image replaces the default 3D view button which is shown in the image gallery on the WooCommerce product page. See <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html#woocommerce">below</a> for more info.</dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:elementor_widget]

    <h2>Elementor Widget</h2>

    <p>
      This feature allows you to embed uploaded Verge3D applications to Elementor pages. Simply drag-and-drop the *Verge3D* widget from the *General* tab (or by using search):
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/elementor-widget.webp" class="with-border" alt="Elementor widget from embedding WebGL applications in WordPress">

    <p>
      and select the application you need on the *Content* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/elementor-widget-settings.webp" class="with-border" alt="Elementor widget settings">

    <p>
      You can set the size of the canvas and other app features in the <a href="manual/en/introduction/Wordpress-Plugin.html#application_settings">application settings</a>.
    </p>


    [anchor:interacting_with_buttons]

    <h2>Interacting with Buttons</h2>

    <p>
      With Puzzles, you can easily hook the buttons designed in WordPress (or other button-like elements) to the 3D scene. By clicking a button you can trigger various events in your scene, such as playing animation, doing material customizations, uploading textures, playing sounds, etc. Sometimes this is the most straightforward way to implement UI for your app without the need to develop a <a href="manual/en/introduction/HTML-based-user-interfaces.html">full-featured HTML UI</a>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/wordpress/spinner-with-button.webp" class="with-border" alt="Example of the page with a Verge3D app embedded, controlled by a button dropped from the Block Editor toolbox">
      <figcaption>Example of the page with a Verge3D app embedded, controlled by a button dropped from the Block Editor toolbox.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Buttons from Built-In Editor (aka Block Editor)</h3>

    <p>
      To handle clicks for buttons added with the built-in WordPress editor, first assign a <em>custom CSS class</em>. You can do it by selecting the button and typing your CSS class name in the *Block* → *Advanced* → *ADDITIONAL CSS CLASS(ES)* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/button-class-block-editor.webp" class="with-border" alt="Assigning custom button class in WordPress editor">

    <p>
      Then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#event">event</a> Puzzle to assign event listener on the button element. The element itself is retrieved with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#query_selector">query selector</a> Puzzle:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/button-class-click.webp" alt="Clicking on the button with custom CSS class">

    <p>
      Specify the CSS class assigned on the button as the first term of the selector (the dot prefix means "get element by a CSS class"), followed by the *a* for anchor tag:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
    .my-button a
    </code>

    <p>
      Note, that since Verge3D application is embedded in an iframe, you must also enable *in parent doc*.
    </p>

    <h3>Buttons from Elementor</h3>

    <p>
      Clicks from buttons created with Elementor are handled a bit differently. Instead of class name, you should assign <em>custom ID</em> for your button, which you can do inside the *Edit Button* → *Content* → *Button ID* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/button-id-elementor.webp" class="with-border" alt="Assigning custom button ID in Elementor">

    <p>
      Then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#event">event</a> Puzzle to assign event listener on the button element. The element itself is retrieved with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#query_selector">query selector</a> Puzzle:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/button-id-click.webp" alt="Clicking on the button with custom ID">

    <p>
      Specify the element ID assigned on the button as the first term of the selector (the hash tag means "get element by ID"), followed by the *a* for anchor tag:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">
    #my-button a
    </code>

    <p>
      Note, that since Verge3D application is embedded in an iframe, you must also enable *in parent doc*.
    </p>


    [anchor:woocommerce]

    <h2>WooCommerce Integration</h2>

    <p>
      WooCommerce is a popular e-commerce system which powers over 28% of all online stores. Verge3D offers a seamless integration with WooCommerce via this WordPress plugin and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html">e-commerce puzzles</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please refer to <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/making-3d-product-configurator-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">this tutorial article</a> for the info on how to use this feature. You may also check out the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJdUKwSxA8c" target="_blank">video</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Supported product types</h3>

    <p>
      The plugin supports the following product types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simple</li>
      <li>Grouped</li>
      <li>External/Affiliate</li>
      <li>Variable</li>
      <li>Composite (requires the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/" target="_blank">WooCommerce Composite Products</a> extension)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Check out the [demoLink:drink_shop] and [demoLink:simple_configurator] demos from the Asset Store which show how these product types can be integrated with Verge3D.
    </p>

    <h3>3D only vs 2D gallery + 3D</h3>

    <p>
      You can choose between two methods of embedding your 3D app into WooCommerce product page. The first method is to replace the product image entirely:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/wordpress/woo-replace-product-image.jpg" class="with-border" alt="WebGL app replacing WooCommerce product image">
      <figcaption><a href="https://sandbox.soft8soft.com/product/spinner/" target="_blank">Spinner</a> product page in Verge3D Sandbox.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      This method is especially suitable when your 3D visualization fully describes the look and feel of the product so no additional 2D images are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second method is to add a 3D view button as an item to the gallery of 2D images:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="files/wordpress/woo-add-gallery-item.jpg" class="with-border" alt="WebGL app as item in WooCommerce product gallery images">
      <figcaption><a href="https://sandbox.soft8soft.com/product/4k-curved-tv/" target="_blank">Smart TV</a> product page in Verge3D Sandbox.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To select which method to use, you can simply switch the *Show as gallery item* setting on the *Product data* panel (see below).
    </p>

    <h3>Product Settings</h3>

    <p>
      For each product supported there is a set of plugin-specific settings located on the *Verge3D* tab of the *Product data*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/wordpress/woo-product-settings.jpg" alt="Verge3D settings for WooCommerce product">

    <dl>
      <dt>Application</dt>
      <dd>Verge3D application which will be displayed on the product page.</dd>
      <dt>Show as gallery item</dt>
      <dd>Run application upon clicking on the 3D View button in the gallery, or entirely replace the product image by 3D visualization.</dd>
      <dt>Switch to 3D on update</dt>
      <dd>When running a 3D app as gallery item, enable this setting to automatically slide to the 3D view upon product updates. This feature is useful mostly for configurable *Grouped* or *Variable* products. If disabled, WooCommerce would switch to the first 2D image when the user chooses something from the proposed configurations.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Using Puzzles</h3>

    <p>
      With <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#woo_connect">connect to WooCommerce</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#woo_product_info">product info</a> puzzles you can implement quite advanced applications (such as 3D configurators) by retrieving the data on the products or selected configurations from WooCommerce product page.
    </p>

    [demo:spinner]


    [anchor:e_commerce_system]

    <h2>Alternative E-Commerce System</h2>

    <p>
      E-commerce system which comes with Verge3D for WordPress plug-in is a self-sufficient option alternative to WooCommerce. It allows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>placing customer orders, submitted with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order">place order</a>, <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order_adv">place order+</a>, or <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Advanced.html#send_data">send data</a> puzzles.</li>
      <li>sending notification emails to customers or sales staff.</li>
      <li>generating quotes and invoices, attaching these to emails.</li>
      <li>attaching various data to the orders: PDF, custom text, JSONs, images, sounds, or videos.</li>
      <li>processing payments via PayPal or cards.</li>
      <li>distributing downloadable products.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The system does not rely on any third-party plugins and can be easily customized with PHP to meet your needs.
    </p>


    [anchor:receiving_orders_with_order_form]

    <h3>Receiving Orders with Order Form</h3>

    <p>
      To handle regular orders sent by your Verge3D applications (by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order">place order</a> or <a href="manual/en/puzzles/ECommerce.html#place_order_adv">place order+</a> puzzles), add an order form to some of your WordPress page/post using the following shortcode:
    </p>

    <code>[verge3d_order]</code>

    <p>
      Then specify the link to that page/post as the "send to" parameter of the *place order*/<strong>place order +</strong> puzzles. Each time this puzzle is executed, your app will redirect users to your order form:
    </p>

    [anchor:uploading_files]

    <h2>Uploading Files</h2>

    <p>
      This feature allows the users to persistently store content created in Verge3D applications, such as taken screenshots, uploaded textures, and saved configurations.
    </p>

    <p>
      To upload your file on the server use the following REST API method:
    </p>

    <code class="language-html">https://WP_HOST/wp-json/verge3d/v1/upload_file/</code>

    <p>
      Where WP_HOST is the host name of your WordPress server, such as <em>sandbox.soft8soft.com</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon success this method returns the following JSON file with the info on the uploaded file:
    </p>

    <code>
    {
        "status": "ok",
        "statusText": "Yay! File uploaded successfully.",
        "id": THE_ID_OF_THE_UPLOADED_FILE,
        "link": LINK_TO_THE_UPLOADED_FILE,
        "size": FILE_SIZE
    }
    </code>
