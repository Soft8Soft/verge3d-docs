    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p>
      In this guide we show how to create and render lines using Verge3D API.
    </p>

    <h2>Thin Lines</h2>

    <p>
      Thin lines are easier to create, but due to limitations imposed by WebGL, cannot be thicker than 1px. Do draw such lines first define a [page:LineBasicMaterial] material.
    </p>

    <code>
    // create a blue LineBasicMaterial
    const material = new v3d.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff });
    </code>

    <p>
      After material we will need a geometry with some vertices:
    </p>

    <code>
    const points = [];
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3(-10, 0, 0));
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3( 0, 10, 0));
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3( 10, 0, 0));

    const geometry = new v3d.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);
    </code>

    <p>
      Note that lines are drawn between each consecutive pair of vertices, but not between the first and last (the line is not closed).
    </p>

    <p>Now that we have points for two lines and a material, we can put them together to form a line:</p>

    <code>
    const line = new v3d.Line(geometry, material);
    </code>

    <p>All that's left is to add it to the scene.</p>

    <code>
    app.scene.add(line);
    </code>

    <p>You should now be seeing an arrow pointing upwards, made from two blue lines.</p>

    <h2>Thick Lines</h2>

    <p>
      Thick lines created by [page:MeshLine] or [page:MeshLineIndexed] class depending on the source data you provide. Similarly to thin lines they require a special material which is now called [page:MeshLineMaterial].
    </p>

    <code>
    // create a blue MeshLineMaterial
    const material = new v3d.MeshLineMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff, lineWidth: 0.3 });
    </code>

    <p>
      `lineWidth` is the absolute width of the line in world units, not the pixel size.
    </p>

    <p>
      To generate the line with triangulated geometry you need to pass some points to [page:MeshLineIndexed].
    </p>

    <code>
    const points = [];
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3(-10, 0, 0));
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3( 0, 10, 0));
    points.push(new v3d.Vector3( 10, 0, 0));

    const geometry = new v3d.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);

    const line = new v3d.MeshLineIndexed();
    line.fromBufferGeometry(geometry);
    </code>

    <p>
      The good thing, is that such geometry can be used with regular [page:Mesh] objects:
    </p>

    <code>
    const mesh = new v3d.Mesh(line.geometry, material);
    </code>

    <p>
      Adding this mesh to the scene will get you the same arrow, but way thicker:
    </p>

    <code>
    app.scene.add(mesh);
    </code>
