    <h1>Variables</h1>

    <p>
      Variable is a named storage for some known or unknown value. The value can be changed in your program (varies, hence the name).

    <h2>Creating Variables</h2>

    <p>
    Variables can be created in several different ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You may create a variable by clicking the button <strong>Create variable...</strong> and choosing any name for it. The name, wherever it appears in the program, can be changed via the variable's dropdown menu any time later.</li>
      <li>Procedures can define inputs, which creates variables that can be used only within the procedure. These are traditionally called <i>parameters</i> or <i>arguments</i>.</li>
      <li>Every "count with" and "for each" puzzle uses a variable and defines its values. These values can only be used within the puzzle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    A typical use case for variable is when you have an object that can be in several states. For example, a door can be open or closed, and if you want to animate it properly you need to know in which exactly status it is now.
    </p>

    <h3>change</h3>
