    <h2>Puzzles Reference</h2>

    [anchor:show]

    <h3>show</h3>

    <p>
      Makes a specified object, that was initially or previously hidden, visible. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, or an object is already visible, does nothing.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-show.webp" alt="Show 3D object visual programming block">


    [anchor:hide]

    <h3>hide</h3>

    <p>
      Makes a specified object invisible. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, or an object is already invisible, does nothing.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-hide.webp" alt="Hide 3D object visual programming block">


    [anchor:is_visible]

    <h3>is visible</h3>

    <p>
      Checks if an object (or any of objects in a list) is currently visible. If it so, returns the logical value *true*, otherwise returns *false*. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, returns *false*.
    </p>

    [anchor:clone]

    <h3>clone object</h3>

    <p>
      Makes an object copy, generates a unique name for the new object and immediately adds it to the scene. Outputs the new object name. Does not work with lists, groups or the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-clone.webp" alt="Clone 3D object with visual programming">

    <p>
      This puzzles supports additional options which can be activated via the gear icon:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-clone-advanced.webp" alt="Advanced clone object params">

    <dl>
      <dt>also clone materials</dt>
      <dd>
        By default the "clone object" puzzle does not perform material cloning, hence the same material will be assigned to the cloned object. Enable *also clone materials* if you wish to clone the material (or materials) as well.
      </dd>
      <dt>preserve object groups</dt>
      <dd>
        By default the "clone object" puzzles resets <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#select_group">object groups</a> for the cloned object. Enable *preserve object groups* to transfer groups from the original object.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    [demo:clone_object]


    [anchor:create_object]

    <h3>create object</h3>

    <p>
      Creates and adds a new object to the scene. This puzzles creates objects without the need in a 3D editor, and as such is useful for learning visual programming as well as designing primitive visuals by users with no or minimal 3D modelling skills. By using this this puzzle in combination with <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#make_object_from">make object from</a> you can create really complex geometry.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-create-object.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to create various 3D objects">

    <p>
      For geometry objects, such as boxes or teapots, this puzzle also creates white-colored dielectric node-based PBR material (with roughness value set to `1` and metalness set to `0`). Use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#materials_set_color">set color</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#materials_set_value">set value</a> puzzles to tweak that material.
    </p>
    <p>
      For *plane with texture* objects, this puzzle assigns a dummy checker texture to the model. Use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#replace_texture">replace texture</a> puzzle to change this texture.
    </p>

    [anchor:remove]

    <h3>remove object</h3>

    <p>
      Removes a specified object from the scene. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, does nothing.
    </p>

    [anchor:set_transform]

    <h3>set transform</h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes you need to input a vector (which consists of the given X, Y, Z coordinates). In this case, you can modify the puzzle by clicking on the gear icon and setting on checkbox *use vector*. The *world space* checkbox enables transformations in world space (does euler rotation in XYZ order), otherwise does transformations in object's space.
    </p>


    [anchor:get_transform]

    <h3>get transform</h3>

    <p>
      Retrieves the position, rotation or scale data of an object.

    [anchor:set_object_direction]

    <h3>set object direction</h3>

    <p>
      Set an object's direction to the point/vector with *X*, *Y*, *Z* coordinates. The *point* checkbox specifies whether the *X*, *Y*, *Z* coordinates belong to some point in 3D space or represent a direction vector. The *lock up* checkbox locks the up-down axis of the object so it remains perpendicular to the horizontal surface.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-set-object-direction.jpg" alt="Set object direction visual logic block">

    [anchor:make_object_from]

    <h3>make object from</h3>

    <p>
      Create a new object by applying boolean (also called CSG or constructive solid geometry) operation on two input objects. The input objects are not affected and should be hidden/removed explicitly.

      For example, to add an annotation to the "Cube" object with "1" as label and "This is point of interest #1" as description:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-add-annotation-example.jpg" alt="Example of HTML annotations created with visual programming">

    <p>
      You can assign custom name for the annotation object, instead of default value, equal to the annotation label. For this you need to modify the puzzle by clicking on the gear icon and setting on the checkbox *enable "name" option*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-add-annotation-custom-name.webp" alt="Assign object name for the annoation">

    <p>
      The *add annotation* puzzle creates 2 HTML elements (for label and description) which can be <a href="manual/en/introduction/App-Manager.html#app_settings_annotation_tab">styled in App Manager settings</a> or with <a href="manual/en/introduction/Personalizing-Verge3D-Apps.html#annotations">CSS classes</a>.
    </p>

    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-add-annotation-element-ids.jpg" alt="HTML layout of 3D annotations">

    <p>
      By default, an annotation obscured by some geometry is automatically closed and become semi-transparent. This behavior can be disabled by turning off the *fade annotations* option of the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Initialization.html#configure_application">configure application</a> puzzle.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-add-annotation-fading.jpg" alt="Example of annotation fading">

    <p>
      You can use a more low-level alternative, the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#bind_element">bind element</a> puzzle, instead but it won't expand upon clicking and won't be obscured by geometry.
    </p>


    [anchor:remove_annotation]
