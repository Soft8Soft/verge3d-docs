    <h1>AR/VR Puzzles</h1>

    <p>These puzzles are used to enable web-based Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) experiences running on top of the browser technology called WebXR (eXtended Reality on the Web).</p>

    <h3>check VR mode</h3>

    <p>
      Checks the virtual reality system. If successful, the puzzles in the *if available do* are triggered. Otherwise, if the browser does not support VR or VR hardware not found, the puzzles in the *if unavailable do* slot are triggered.
    </p>

    [anchor:enter_vr_mode]

    <h3>enter VR mode</h3>

    <p>
      Enters the virtual reality mode. Puzzles placed in the *on enter do* and *on exit do* slots are triggered upon entering or exiting the VR mode. Puzzles placed in the *if unavailable do* are triggered if a VR session could not be established.
    </p>

    <p>VR positioning modes:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        sitting or standing
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Immobile camera positioned at some height above the ground. The center of the world coordinate space located just under the user's feet. This mode is recommended because it's compatible with the most popular VR headsets available on the market such as Oculus Quest 1-2, HTC Vive etc.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        looking around
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Immobile camera positioned at zero coordinates.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        room
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Mobile camera located inside some bounds such as room.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        walking
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Mobile unbounded camera.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        viewer locked
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Immobile camera positioned at zero coordinates. All content is parented to the view.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In order to properly control the camera in VR mode, be sure to snap and parent it to some empty/dummy or real object, positioned in the 3D editor of your choice, upon entering the VR mode. This is needed because the VR session has the full control over your camera, and you can move only the empty/dummy object to which the camera is parented.
    </p>

    [anchor:check_ar_mode]

    <h3>check AR mode</h3>

    <p>
      Checks the augmented reality system (WebXR). If successful, the puzzles in the *if available do* slot are triggered. Otherwise, if the browser does not support AR or AR hardware not found, the puzzles in the *else if unavailable do* slot are triggered. The puzzles in the *else if Apple USDZ do* slot are triggered when no WebXR-compatible hardware found, but the system supports USDZ-based Apple AR Quick Look technology.

    <p>
      Property *allow HTML* is used to display HTML content in AR mode. If specified, the content of the <em>canvas container</em> element will be rendered above 3D content. This option is considered experimental.

    <p>AR positioning modes:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        looking around
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Immobile camera positioned at zero coordinates. This mode is recommended for typical AR use cases, e.g for positioning a model on some horizontal or vertical surface.

      <dt>
        sitting or standing

    [anchor:ar_hit_test]

    <h3>detect surface AR</h3>

    <p>
      Detect surfaces in AR mode by casting a ray forward. Upon intersection, this ray will trigger puzzles in *on intersection do* slot. If no intersection occurred or the device is in warming-up state the puzzles triggers *if missed do* slot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parameter *smooth* is used to make AR marker movement smoother. Specify value 0 to disable smoothing, value close to 1 for maximum smoothing.
    </p>

    [anchor:ar_hit_point]

    <h3>AR hit point</h3>

    <p>
      Surface point coordinate(s) detected by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/AR_VR.html#ar_hit_test">detect surface AR</a> puzzle. Can be *X*, *Y*, *Z* value, or *XYZ* vector.
    </p>

    <h3>AR hit normal</h3>

    <p>
      Surface normal vector detected by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/AR_VR.html#ar_hit_test">detect surface AR</a> puzzle. Can be *X*, *Y*, *Z* value, or *XYZ* vector.
    </p>

    [anchor:xr_camera_control_object]

    <h3>camera control object</h3>

    <p>
      Get camera control object. By offsetting this object (e.g. with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#set_transform">set transform</a> puzzle), you can efficiently move the camera in the AR or VR mode. This spares you from the need to maintain some empty object specifically to parent and snap the camera to, as this object is created or dropped automatically when entering or exiting WebXR.
    </p>

    [anchor:session_event]

    <h3>on session event</h3>

    <p>
      Captures a VR session event generated by a VR device (e.g. a headset or controller button) and triggers puzzles specified in the *do* slot.
    </p>

      <li>*profiles* - a list of controller profile names.
      <li>*gamepad index* - a controller gamepad index which can be passed to the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#get_gamepad_prop">get gamepad property</a> puzzle to retrieve more info from your controller, such as the status of buttons/axes.</li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:end_vr_session]

    <h3>end AR/VR session</h3>

    <p>
      Ends a virtual reality or augmented reality session.
