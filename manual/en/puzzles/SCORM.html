    <h1>E-Learning/SCORM Plugin</h1>

    <p>
      This stock <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Plugins.html">plugin</a> adds puzzles that can be used for implementing SCORM-based e-learning applications. The plugin supports <a href="https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/technical-scorm/run-time/run-time-reference/#section-2" target="_blank">version 1.2</a> of the SCORM standard.
    </p>

    [anchor:lms_initialize]

    <h3>lms initialize</h3>

    <p>Start a communication session with the LMS.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-initialize.jpg" alt="Visual logic block to connect to SCORM">


    [anchor:lms_finish]

    <h3>lms finish</h3>

    <p>Close a communication session with the LMS. You can exec this puzzle any time when you done communicating, however it's better to include it in the "beforeunload" event handler.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-finish.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to finish SCORM session">


    [anchor:lms_set_value]

    <h3>lms set value</h3>

    <p>Set a value for the given LMS <a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#data_model_elements">element</a>.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-set-value.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to set value in learning management system">


    [anchor:lms_get_value]

    <h3>lms get value</h3>

    <p>Retrieves a value from the LMS <a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#data_model_elements">element</a>.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-get-value.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to get value from learning management system">


    [anchor:lms_commit]

    <h3>lms commit</h3>

    <p>Report to LMS that it should sync data received by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#lms_set_value">lms set value</a> puzzle. Executing commit is not strictly required, however it can increase responsiveness of the UI in some LMS. For example, the Moodle LMS updates scores and lesson status upon commit.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-commit.jpg" alt="Visual coding block to sync data with learning management system">


    [anchor:lms_get_last_error]

    <h3>lms get last error</h3>

    <p>Returns the error code (encoded as string) that resulted from the last communication with LMS. The "0" value indicates that there is no error happened.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-get-last-error.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to get error from learning management system">


    [anchor:lms_get_error_string]

    <h3>lms get error string</h3>

    <p>Returns a short string describing the specified error code.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-get-error-string.jpg" alt="Block for retrieving error string from learning management system">


    [anchor:lms_get_diagnostic]

    <h3>lms get diagnostic</h3>

    <p>Returns detailed information about the last error that occurred.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-lms-get-diagnostic.jpg" alt="Get SCORM diagnostics with visual programming">


    [anchor:data_model_elements]

    <h3>data model elements</h3>

    <p>List of the data model elements which can be assigned/retrieved by the SCORM package.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-data-model-elements.jpg" alt="Retrive SCORM data elements with visual logic block">

    <p class="note">
      In SCORM terminology, "element" is just a parameter which is send to/received from the LMS. It has nothing to do with "HTML elements".

    <p>
      For simplicity, this puzzle includes only "core" elements. If you need to pass other (including non-standard) elements to <a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#lms_set_value">lms set value</a>/<a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#lms_get_value">lms get value</a>, use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Text.html#text">text</a> puzzle:

    [anchor:pack_add_item]

    <h3>pack add item</h3>

    <p>Add an item to the manifest of the generated SCORM pack.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scorm-pack-add-item.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to add items to SCORM pack">

    <p>
      This puzzle is useful for creating multi-page courses which can run different content depending on the selected item.
    </p>

    <p>
      To retrieve the current item ID use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/SCORM.html#pack_get_item_id">pack get item ID</a> puzzle.
    </p>


    [anchor:pack_get_item_id]

    <h3>pack get item ID</h3>

    <p>Retrieve an ID of the currently loaded item from the SCORM pack.</p>
