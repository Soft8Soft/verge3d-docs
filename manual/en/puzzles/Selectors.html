    <h1>Selectors</h1>

    <p>
      The puzzles from this category are used to select 3D objects, groups, animation clips and materials to fit in other puzzles.

    <h2>Puzzles Reference</h2>


    [anchor:select_object]

    <h3>select object</h3>

    <p>
      The drop-down contains an alphabetized list of all objects on the scene.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-object.webp" alt="Select object visual programming block">


    [anchor:all_objects]

    <h3>all objects</h3>

    <p>
      Denotes all objects on the scene so that an operation can be applied to them in bulk.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-all-objects.webp" alt="All objects visual programming block">

    <p>
      This puzzle is not iterable, e.g. it can't be used as input for the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Loops.html#for_each">for each in list</a> puzzle. To iterate over a list of objects, use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#get_objects_from">get objects from</a> puzzle.
    </p>


    [anchor:select_group]

    <h3>select group</h3>

    <p>
      The drop-down contains an alphabetized list of all object groups presented in the scene. An operation can be applied to a group of objects in bulk.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-group.webp" alt="Select group visual programming block">

    <p>
      What the "group" actually represents depends on your modeling suite. In Blender, this is <strong><em>collection</em></strong> of objects (the most top-level "Scene Collection" is never exposed to Puzzles):
    </p>

    <p>
      In 3ds Max, this can be either <strong><em>group</em></strong> ("Furniture") or <strong><em>selection set</em></strong> ("Furniture2"):
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-group-max.webp" alt="3ds Max group and selection set" style="max-width: 610px">

    <p>
      In Maya, this can be either <strong><em>group</em></strong> ("Furniture") or <strong><em>set</em></strong> ("Furniture2"):
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-group-maya.webp" alt="Maya group and object set" style="max-width: 358px">

    <p>
      The "select group" puzzle is not iterable, e.g. it can't be used as input for the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Loops.html#for_each">for each in list</a> puzzle. To iterate over a list of objects, use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#get_objects_from">get objects from</a> puzzle.
    </p>


    [anchor:select_animation]

    <h3>select animation</h3>

    <p>
      The drop-down contains an alphabetized list of all animation clips presented in the scene. An animation clip is named according to the object to which animation is applied in Blender, 3ds Max or Maya.
    </p>

    [anchor:select_material]

    <h3>select material</h3>

    <p>
      The drop-down contains an alphabetized list of all materials that are present in the scene.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-material.jpg" alt="Select material visual programming block">


    [anchor:get_entity_by_name]

    <h3>get by name</h3>

    <p>
      Select an entity (object, group, animation clip, or material) given by its name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-selector-get-entity-by-name.jpg" alt="Get by name visual programming block">

    <p>
      The most common use case for this puzzle is dynamic scene loading, when the names of the loaded entities can't be selected via the list-based selectors.
