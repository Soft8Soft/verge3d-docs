    <h1>Animation and Constraint Puzzles</h1>

    <p>
      The puzzles from this category are used to perform operations with animation clips, do procedural animations, as well as restrict the movement of the objects.

    <h2>Animation Puzzles Reference</h2>

    [anchor:play_animation]

    <h3>play animation</h3>

    <p>
      Plays an animation clip. Animation clip names correspond to objects to which animation is assigned in Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya (only one animation clip can be assigned per object). Use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#select_animation" target="_parent">animation selector</a> puzzle to provide an animation clip for this puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the *from* and *to* fields to specify the frame range. Use the *speed* field to specify the playback speed. The *reversed* checkbox enables reversed playback. The drop-down can be used to change the animation mode — "auto" allows for using the animation mode specified in the modelling suite, while the other modes override the settings specified in Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya.
    </p>

    <p>
      Puzzles in the <strong>when finished: do</strong> slot are processed once the animation is finished (this only is valid for the *once* animation mode).
    </p>

    <p>
      This puzzle also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>


    [anchor:stop_animation]

    <h3>stop animation</h3>

    <p>
    Stops playing back an animation clip. Also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>

    [anchor:pause_animation]

    <h3>pause animation</h3>

    <p>
    Pauses an animation clip playback so that it can be resumed later starting from the frame it was paused on. Also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-pause.jpg" alt="Visual coding block to pause animation">



    [anchor:resume_animation]

    <h3>resume animation</h3>

    <p>
    Resumes a previously paused animation clip. Also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-resume.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to resume animation">



    [anchor:set_animation_frame]

    <h3>set animation frame</h3>

    <p>
    Sets an animation clip to a specified frame. Also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-set-animation-frame.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to set animation frame">


    [anchor:get_animation_frame]

    <h3>get animation frame</h3>

    <p>Get current frame of an animation clip.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-get-animation-frame.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to obtain animation frame">


    [anchor:is_animation_playing]

    <h3>is animation playing</h3>

    <p>
    Checks if an animation clip (or any of animations in a list) is currently being played back.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-is-playing.jpg" alt="Is animation playing visual logic block">


    [anchor:set_animation_speed]

    <h3>set animation speed</h3>

    <p>
      Changes the animation playback speed. Animation doesn't restart on speed changing. The *reversed* checkbox reverses the animation speed (i.e the speed is multiplied by -1). Also works for a list of animation clips.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-set-animation-speed.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to set animation speed" style="max-width: 1104px;">


    [anchor:get_animation_speed]

    <h3>get animation speed</h3>

    <p>
      Get the animation playback speed.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-get-animation-speed.jpg" alt="Visual logic block to obtain animation speed">


    [anchor:on_animation_frame_do]

    <h3>on animation frame do</h3>

    <p>
      Execute puzzles specified in the *do* slot upon animation frame.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-on-animation-frame-do.jpg" alt="On animation frame do visual programming block">


    [anchor:get_animation]

    <h3>get animation of</h3>

    <p>
    Retrieves a specified object's animation clip. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. The return value is always a list of animation clips (even if there is only one of them).
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-get-animation.jpg" alt="Get object animation visual programming block">


    [anchor:clone_animation]

    <h3>clone animation</h3>

    <p>
    Clones an animation clip (or a list of animations) in the specified range
    (both inclusive).
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-clone-animation.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to clone animations">


    [anchor:animate_param]

    <h3>animate param</h3>

    <p>
    Animates a numeric parameter (or all parameters in a list or a <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Dictionaries.html">dictionary</a>) in between *from* and *to*, during a period specified with *duration* (in seconds). The *easing* dropdown allows you to specify the animation mode (see below).
    </p>

    <p>
    The *repeat* field specifies the number of repetitions after the first animation is complete. The *yoyo* checkbox enables backtrack movement (works for *repeat* > 1).
    </p>

    <p>
    Puzzles in the *on update do* slot are triggered every rendering frame while the parameter is animated. Puzzles in the *when finished do* slot are triggered once the animation is finished.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-animate-param.jpg" alt="Animate param visual programming block">

    <p>
    This puzzle wraps the <a href="https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md" target="_blank">Tween.js</a> library, exposing its all <a href="http://tweenjs.github.io/tween.js/examples/03_graphs.html" target="_blank">31 easing modes</a> (pictured), duration, repeat and yoyo settings, and the update and complete callbacks.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-animate-param-easing-modes.jpg" alt="Various animation easing modes">

    <p>
    The in-between value may be retrieved with an <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#updated_value">updated value</a> puzzle usually placed inside the *on update do* slot.
    </p>


    [anchor:updated_value]

    <h3>updated value</h3>

    <p>
    Returns the in-between value produced by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#animate_param">animate param</a> puzzle. Depending on the type of the animated parameter, can be a number, a list or a <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Dictionaries.html">dictionary</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-updated-value.jpg" alt="Updated value visual programming block">

    <p>
    This puzzle may be placed anywhere in a scenario, but naturally works in the *on update do* slot of the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#animate_param">animate param</a> puzzle where it is updated every frame.
    </p>


    [anchor:animate_param_stop]

    <h3>stop animate param</h3>

    <p>
      Stops the animation produced by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#animate_param">animate param</a> puzzle.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation-animate-param-stop.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to stop procedural animation">


    [anchor:constraints_puzzles_reference]

    <h2>Constraints Puzzles Reference</h2>

    <p>
    If an object is not parented to another object, the constraints will work in world space. Otherwise they will work in the parent object's space - you can select the parent object in Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya to show up the coordinate axes.
    </p>


    [anchor:limit_transform]

    <h3>limit transform</h3>

    <p>
    Creates a constraint to limit object position, rotation or scale along a selected axis. Constraint *id* should be unique, otherwise an existing constraint with the same id will be replaced. The *min* and *max* slots specify the range between which the movement is allowed. The constraint can limit distance between two objects, thus *distance* slot specifies the distance limit, i.e. the radius of the constraining sphere, *equal*, *max*, *min* modes constrain <i>on surface, inside, outside</i> the sphere.
    </p>

    [anchor:copy_transform]

    <h3>copy transform</h3>

    <p>
    Creates a constraint to copy object position, rotation, scale or all transforms from another object. Constraint *id* should be unique, otherwise an existing constraint with the same id will be replaced.
    </p>

    <p><a href="manual/en/puzzles/Physics.html#operations" id="operations" class="permalink"></a></p>

    [anchor:remove_mute_unmute_constraint]

    <h3>remove / mute / unmute constraint</h3>

    <p>
    Removes, mutes or unmutes a constraint assigned to a specified object. Other constraints assigned to this object (if any) will remain intact.
    </p>
