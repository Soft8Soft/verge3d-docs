    <p>
    Procedure (aka function) is a named group of puzzles that performs a specific task. By organizing your puzzles in procedures you can make your scenarios more compact and maintainable.

    <h2>Creating Procedures</h2>

    <p>
      A new procedure can be created by dragging out the procedure definition puzzle from the toolbox:
    </p>

    <p>
      A newly created procedure puzzle can be renamed and filled up with other puzzles to perform some task:
    </p>

    [anchor:calling_procedures]

    <h2>Calling Procedures</h2>

    <p>
      To be able to trigger (to call) a procedure, drag out the corresponding puzzle from the toolbox:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-trigger.jpg" alt="Running visual programming procedure">

    <p>
      A procedure can be triggered several times and from several places of a Puzzles scenario. This may allow for re-using puzzles rather than straight-copying similar set of puzzles several times. For example, an animation can be launched whenever the user clicks the object itself or an HTML button (thus securing duplicate controls).
    </p>

    <p>
      A procedure may have additional input parameters (aka arguments). To add an input to your procedure, click the gear icon and drag out a parameter puzzle from the toolbox on the left, sticking it in the inputs puzzle:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-inputs.jpg" alt="Arguments of visual programming procedures">

    <p>
      To be able to use an input parameter inside a procedure, drag out the corresponding "get" variable puzzle created automatically in "Variables":
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-inputs2.jpg" alt="Procedure params shown as variables in the visual logic editor">

    <p>
      This variable can be used as a substitute for actual data (such as object names) to perform some task with.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-inputs3.jpg" alt="Example of procedure argument">

    <p>
      When triggering a procedure with inputs, provide the data for each trigger puzzle.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-trigger-with-inputs.jpg" alt="Calling visual programming procedures with arguments multiple times">

    <p>
      You can jump from a trigger puzzle to the corresponding procedure definition puzzle using the right-click menu:
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-procedures-jump.jpg" alt="Jump to procedure in visual logic editor">

    <p>
      Procedures can also be called by using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Advanced.html#get_procedure">get procedure</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Advanced.html#call_procedure">call procedure</a> puzzles. This way a procedure can be obtained, stored in a variable, passed into another procedure as a parameter and called later whenever needed.
    </p>


    [anchor:procedure_with_return]

    <h2>Procedures with Return Value</h2>

    <p>
      A procedure may output a computed value to its caller (aka return value). To create such a procedure, from the toolbox drag out the variant of the procedure puzzle with the return slot.
    </p>

    [anchor:if_return]

    <h2>Using "if return" Puzzle</h2>

    <p>
      A procedure may return a value upon some condition before all inside puzzles are interpreted. In this case the procedure stops running prematurely.
    </p>

    [anchor:calling_procedures_javascript]

    <h2>Calling Procedures from JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
      To execute Puzzles procedures from JavaScript code use either the `puzzles` argument of the `runCode()` function of *your_app_name.js* module or the built-in `puzzles` variable inside the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Advanced.html#exec_script">exec script</a> puzzle:
    </p>

    <code>
    puzzles.procedures['myProcedure']();
    </code>
