    These puzzles provide means for specifying iterations in your Puzzles scenario.

    <h2>Infinite Loops Caveat</h2>

    <p>
      Be careful with these puzzles as it is easy to create infinite loops and hang your browser. If you happened to save such a wrongful scenario, you can restore a previous version of your puzzles from <a href="manual/en/introduction/Puzzles-Visual-Logic-Editor.html#Backup">backup</a>.

    [anchor:repeat]

    <h3>repeat</h3>

    <p>
      This puzzle runs the puzzles placed in the *do* slot the specified number of times.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-repeat.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to create repeats">

    <p>
      For example, the following set of puzzles creates several copies of the cube and places them randomly on the scene.
    </p>

    [anchor:for_each]

    <h3>for each in list</h3>

    <p>
      This puzzle iterates through a specified list and runs the puzzles placed in the *do* slot for each item in that list. The items for corresponding iteration are accessible via an automatically created <a href='manual/en/puzzles/Variables.html'>variable</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-for-each.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to create for-each loops">

    <p>
      For example, the following set of puzzles adds annotations to all objects from the list.
    </p>

    [anchor:for_each_in_dict]

    <h3>for each in dict</h3>

    <p>
      This puzzle iterates through a specified dictionary and runs the puzzles placed in the *do* slot for each item in that dictionary. The items for corresponding iteration are accessible via an automatically created key/value <a href='manual/en/puzzles/Variables.html'>variables</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-for-each-in-dict.webp" alt="Visual programming block to create for-each loops for dictionaries">

    <p>
      For example, the following set of puzzles prints flight directions stored in the dictionary to the browser console.
    </p>

    [anchor:count_with]

    <h3>count with</h3>

    <p>
      This puzzle is similar to <a href='manual/en/puzzles/Loops.html#for_each'>for each</a>, except it gives the loop variable values in a numeric sequence.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-count-with.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to create counters">

    <p>
      For example, the following set of puzzles counts from `2` to `10` with the step `2`, thus creating numbers `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` and `10`, clones the cube on each step, and uses those numbers to position the copies along X axis.
    </p>

    [anchor:repeat_while_until]

    <h3>repeat while / until</h3>

    <p>
      The *repeat while* puzzle runs the puzzles placed in the *do* slot as long as a specified logical <a href='manual/en/puzzles/Logic.html#comparison'>condition</a> is true. On the contrary, the *repeat until* puzzle stops running just after a specified logical condition evaluates to false.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-repeat-while-until.jpg" alt="Visual programming block to create while and until loops">

    <p>
      This puzzle is well suited for situations when something is changing inside the loop and this affects your decision to continue or stop performing the iterations. For example, the following set of puzzles, which uses the *repeat while* variant, keeps asking for the user's answer as long as the user answers "yes".
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-repeat-while-example.jpg" alt="Example of while loop">

    <p>
      You can use the *repeat until* variant to ask the same question but in a slightly more annoying manner, making the answer "no" the only option to stop this.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-repeat-until-example.jpg" alt="Example of until loop">


    [anchor:break_continue]

    <h3>break / continue</h3>

    <p>
      Most loops run until the terminating condition (in the case of *repeat* puzzles) is met or until all values have been taken by the loop variable (in the case of *count with* and *for each* puzzles). This puzzle provide additional means for controlling loop behavior. Although the below examples use the *for each* puzzle, they can be used with any type of loop.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-break-continue.jpg" alt="Break/continue visual logic operators">

    <p>
      The *break* variant provides an early exit. For example, the following set of puzzles performs search for an object named "Cube". Once it is found and the result variable is set, there is no need to iterate any further, and as such we break out of the loop.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-loops-break-example.jpg" alt="Example on using break visual programming operator">

    <p>
      On the other hand, the *continue* variant skips the current iteration so that the next iteration of the loop begins. For example, the following set of puzzles adds annotations to all objects on the scene except "Cube".
    </p>
