    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint which makes the constrained object track the target and
      also locks on of the object's axes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Object3D target])</h3>

    <p class="params">[page:Object3D target] — constraint's target object.</p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean fixCameraLightRotation]</h3>
    <p>
      In Verge3D we use right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing in the up direction, but Blender and 3ds Max uses right-handed coordinate system with Z axis pointing in the up direction (<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/wiki/index.php/Coordinate_Systems" target="_blank">Verge3D Wiki</a>). So, to correct the rotation for cameras and lights, set `fixCameraLightRotation = true`. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isLockedTrackConstraint]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are locked track
      constraints. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String lockAxis]</h3>
    <p>
      The axis of the constrained object that is locked. Can be one of the `'X'`, `'Y'`, `'Z'`. Default is `'Y'`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String trackAxis]</h3>
    <p>
      The axis of the constrained object that tracks the target. Can be one of the `'X'`, `'-X'`, `'Y'`, `'-Y'`, `'Z'`, `'-Z'`. Default is `'X'`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
    <p>
      The constraint's type. Equals to `'LockedTrackConstraint'`.
    </p>
