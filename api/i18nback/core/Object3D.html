    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      This is the base class for most objects in Verge3D and provides a set of properties and methods
      for manipulating objects in 3D space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this can be used for grouping objects via the [page:.add](object) method
      which adds the object as a child, however it is better to use [page:Group] for this.
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]()</h3>
    <p>
      The constructor takes no arguments.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <h3>[property:Array animations]</h3>
    <p>Array with object's [page:AnimationClip animation clips].</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
    <p>Whether the object gets rendered into shadow map. Default is `false`.</p>

    <h3>[property:Array children]</h3>
    <p>Array with object's children. See [page:Group] for info on manually grouping objects.</p>

    <h3>[property:Array constraints]</h3>
    <p>Array with object's [page:Constraint constraints].</p>

    <h3>[property:Material customDepthMaterial]</h3>
    <p>
    Custom depth material to be used when rendering to the depth map. Can only be used in context of meshes.
    When shadow-casting with a [page:DirectionalLight] or [page:SpotLight], if you are modifying vertex positions in the vertex shader you must specify a customDepthMaterial for proper shadows. Default is `undefined`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Material customDistanceMaterial]</h3>
    <p>
      Same as [page:.customDepthMaterial customDepthMaterial], but used with [page:PointLight]. Default is `undefined`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean disableChildRendering]</h3>
    <p>
      Object children won't be rendered if `true`. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean frustumCulled]</h3>
    <p>
      When this is set, it checks every frame if the object is in the frustum of the camera before rendering the object. If set to `false` the object gets rendered every frame even if it is not in the frustum of the camera. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean hidpiCompositing]</h3>
    <p>
      Whether the object will be rendered using the special HiDPI compositing pass. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
    <p>readonly – Unique number for this object instance.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isObject3D]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <!-- Verge3D -->
    <h3>[property:Array groupNames]</h3>
    <p>
      An array specifying groups this object belongs to. Used for
      grouping/referencing collections of objects.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
    <p>
      The layer membership of the object. The object is only visible if it has at least one
      layer in common with the [page:Camera] in use. This property can also be used to filter out
      unwanted objects in ray-intersection tests when using [page:Raycaster].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
    <p>The local transform matrix.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean matrixAutoUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      When this is set, it calculates the matrix of position, (rotation or quaternion) and
      scale every frame and also recalculates the matrixWorld property. Default is [page:Object3D.DefaultMatrixAutoUpdate] (true).
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorld]</h3>
    <p>
      The global transform of the object. If the Object3D has no parent, then it's identical to
      the local transform [page:.matrix].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean matrixWorldAutoUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      Default is `true`. If set, then the renderer checks every frame if the object and its children need matrix updates.
      When it isn't, then you have to maintain all matrices in the object and its children yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean matrixWorldNeedsUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
    When this is set, it calculates the matrixWorld in that frame and resets this property
     to false. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 modelViewMatrix]</h3>
    <p>This is passed to the shader and used to calculate the position of the object.</p>

    <h3>[property:String name]</h3>
    <p>Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty string.</p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix3 normalMatrix]</h3>
    <p>
      This is passed to the shader and used to calculate lighting for the object. It is the transpose of the inverse of the upper left 3x3 sub-matrix of this object's modelViewMatrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this special matrix is that simply using the modelViewMatrix could result in a non-unit length of normals (on scaling) or in a non-perpendicular direction (on non-uniform scaling).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand the translation part of the modelViewMatrix is not relevant for the calculation of normals. Thus a Matrix3 is sufficient.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float objectAlpha]</h3>
    <p>
      Object alpha. Used to define the corresponding output in the Blender's <a href="manual/i18nback/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#object_info">object info</a> node.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Color objectColor]</h3>
    <p>
      Object color. Used to define the corresponding output in the Blender's <a href="manual/i18nback/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#object_info">object info</a> node.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer objectIndex]</h3>
    <p>
      Object index. Used to define the corresponding output in the Blender's <a href="manual/i18nback/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#object_info">object info</a> node.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Function onAfterRender]</h3>
    <p>
      An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is rendered.
      This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, geometry,
      material, group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual
      appearance with geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line], [page:Points] or [page:Sprite].
      Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group] or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Function onBeforeRender]</h3>
    <p>
      An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is rendered.
      This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, geometry,
      material, group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual
      appearance with geometries and materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line], [page:Points] or [page:Sprite].
      Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group] or [page:Bone] are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Object3D parent]</h3>
    <p>Object's parent in the [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph]. An object can have at most one parent.</p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>

    <p>Object's local rotation as a [page:Quaternion Quaternion].</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean receiveShadow]</h3>
    <p>Whether the material receives shadows. Default is `false`.</p>

    <h3>[property:Float renderOrder]</h3>
    <p>
      This value allows the default rendering order of [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph]
      objects to be overridden although opaque and transparent objects remain sorted independently. When this property
      is set for an instance of [page:Group Group], all descendants objects will be sorted and rendered together.
      Sorting is from lowest to highest renderOrder. Default value is `0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Euler rotation]</h3>
    <p>
      Object's local rotation (see [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles Euler angles]), in radians.

    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 up]</h3>
    <p>
      This is used by the [page:.lookAt lookAt] method, for example, to determine the orientation of the result.<br>
      Default is [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] — that is, `(0, 1, 0)`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Object userData]</h3>
    <p>
      An object that can be used to store custom data about the Object3D. It should not hold
      references to functions as these will not be cloned.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
    <p>
      [link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this object instance.
      This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be edited.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean visible]</h3>
    <p>Object gets rendered if `true`. Default is `true`.</p>


    <h2>Static Properties</h2>
    <p>
      Static properties and methods are defined per class rather than per instance of that class.
      This means that changing [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] or [page:Object3D.DefaultMatrixAutoUpdate]
      will change the values of [page:.up up] and [page:.matrixAutoUpdate matrixAutoUpdate] for
      `every`  instance of Object3D (or derived classes)  created after the change has
      been made (already created Object3Ds will not be affected).
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 DefaultUp]</h3>
    <p>
      The default [page:.up up] direction for objects, also used as the default position for [page:DirectionalLight],
      [page:HemisphereLight] and [page:Spotlight] (which creates lights shining from the top down).<br>
      Set to (0, 1, 0) by default.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean DefaultMatrixAutoUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      The default setting for [page:.matrixAutoUpdate matrixAutoUpdate] for newly created Object3Ds.
    </p>
