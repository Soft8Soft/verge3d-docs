    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">A class for generating an icosahedron geometry.</p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Float radius], [param:Integer detail])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      radius — default is `1`.<br>
      detail — default is `0`. Setting this to a value greater than 0 adds more vertices making it no longer an icosahedron. When detail is greater than 1, it's effectively a sphere.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Procedural geometry is fun. However, in real life applications this feature is rarely needed. It would be more efficient do design icosahedrons in the preferred modelling suite and export/load to Verge3D via glTF.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Object parameters]</h3>
    <p>
      An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.
    </p>
