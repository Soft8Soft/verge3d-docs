    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      [name] is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry.
      It is constructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point and extend as far out as a given radius.
      It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle.
      It can also be used to create regular polygons, where the number of segments determines the number of sides.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    const geometry = new v3d.CircleGeometry(5, 32);
    const material = new v3d.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffff00 });
    const circle = new v3d.Mesh(geometry, material);
    app.scene.add(circle);
    </code>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Float radius], [param:Integer segments], [param:Float thetaStart], [param:Float thetaLength])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      radius — radius of the circle, default is `1`.<br>
      segments — number of segments (triangles), minimum is `3`, default is `32`.<br>
      thetaStart — start angle for first segment, default is `0` (three o'clock position).<br>
      thetaLength — the central angle, often called theta, of the circular sector. The default is 2&pi; (`2*Math.PI`), which makes for a complete circle.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Procedural geometry is fun. However, in real life applications this feature is rarely needed. It would be more efficient do design circles in the preferred modelling suite and export/load to Verge3D via glTF.

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>See the base [page:BufferGeometry] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Object parameters]</h3>
    <p>
    An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.
