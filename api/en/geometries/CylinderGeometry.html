    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">A class for generating cylinder geometries.</p>

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    const geometry = new v3d.CylinderGeometry(5, 5, 20, 32);
    const material = new v3d.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xffff00});
    const cylinder = new v3d.Mesh(geometry, material);
    app.scene.add(cylinder);
    </code>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Float radiusTop], [param:Float radiusBottom], [param:Float height], [param:Integer radialSegments], [param:Integer heightSegments], [param:Boolean openEnded], [param:Float thetaStart], [param:Float thetaLength])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      radiusTop — radius of the cylinder at the top. Default is `1`.<br>
      radiusBottom — radius of the cylinder at the bottom. Default is `1`.<br>
      height — height of the cylinder. Default is `1`.<br>
      radialSegments — number of segmented faces around the circumference of the cylinder. Default is `32`.<br>
      heightSegments — number of rows of faces along the height of the cylinder. Default is `1`.<br>
      openEnded — a boolean indicating whether the ends of the cylinder are open or capped. Default is `false`, meaning capped.<br>
      thetaStart — start angle for first segment, default is `0` (three o'clock position).<br>
      thetaLength — the central angle, often called theta, of the circular sector. The default is 2&pi; (`2*Math.PI`), which makes for a complete cylinder.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Procedural geometry is fun. However, in real life applications this feature is rarely needed. It would be more efficient do design cylinders in the preferred modelling suite and export/load to Verge3D via glTF.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>See the base [page:BufferGeometry] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Object parameters]</h3>
    <p>
      An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.
    </p>
