    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A KeyframeTrack is a timed sequence of [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame keyframes],
      which are composed of lists of times and related values, and which are used to animate a
      specific property of an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an overview of the different elements of the Verge3D animation system, see the <a href="manual/en/programmers_guide/Animation-system.html">Animation System</a> section of the manual.
    </p>

    <p>
      A `KeyframeTrack` doesn't store its single keyframes as objects in a "keys" array (holding the
      times and the values for each frame together in one place).
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of this there are always two arrays in a `KeyframeTrack`: the [page:.times times] array
      stores the time values for all keyframes of this track in sequential order, and the
      [page:.values values] array contains the corresponding changing values of the animated property.
    </p>

    <p>
      A single value, belonging to a certain point of time, can not only be a simple number, but (for
      example) a vector (if a position is animated) or a quaternion (if a rotation is animated). For
      this reason the values array (which is a flat array, too) might be three or four times as long as the
      times array.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corresponding to the different possible types of animated values there are several subclasses of
      `KeyframeTrack`, inheriting the most properties and methods:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>[page:BooleanKeyframeTrack]</li>
      <li>[page:ColorKeyframeTrack]</li>
      <li>[page:NumberKeyframeTrack]</li>
      <li>[page:QuaternionKeyframeTrack]</li>
      <li>[page:StringKeyframeTrack]</li>
      <li>[page:VectorKeyframeTrack]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some examples of how to manually create [page:AnimationClip AnimationClips] with different sorts
      of KeyframeTracks can be found in the [link:https://github.com/Soft8Soft/verge3d-code-examples/blob/master/jsm/animation/AnimationClipCreator.js AnimationClipCreator]
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since explicit values are only specified for the discrete points of time stored in the times array,
      all values in between have to be interpolated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The track's name is important for the connection of this track with a specific property of the
      animated node (done by [page:PropertyBinding]).
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>


    <h3>[name]([param:String name], [param:Array times], [param:Array values], [param:Integer interpolation])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:String name] — the identifier for the `KeyframeTrack`.<br>
      [page:Array times] — an array of keyframe times, converted internally to a [page:Float32Array Float32Array].<br>
      [page:Array values] — an array with the values related to the times array, converted internally to a [page:Float32Array Float32Array].<br>
      [page:Integer interpolation] — the type of interpolation to use. See [page:Animation Animation Constants] for possible values. Default is [page:Animation InterpolateLinear].
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>


    <h3>[property:String name]</h3>
    <p>
      The track's name can refer to morph targets or [page:SkinnedMesh bones] or possibly other values within an animated object. See
      [page:PropertyBinding.parseTrackName] for the forms of strings that can be parsed for property
      binding:
    </p>

    <p>
      The name can specify the node either using its name or its uuid (although it needs to be in the
      subtree of the scene graph node passed into the mixer). Or, if the track name starts with a dot,
      the track applies to the root node that was passed into the mixer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually after the node a property will be specified directly. But you can also specify a
      subproperty, such as .rotation[x], if you just want to drive the X component of the rotation
      via a float track.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also specify bones or multimaterials by using an object name, for example:
      .bones[R_hand].scale; the red channel of the diffuse color of the fourth material in a
      materials array - as a further example - can be accessed with .materials[3].diffuse[r].
    </p>

    <p>
      PropertyBinding will also resolve morph target names, for example: .morphTargetInfluences[run].
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The track's name does not necessarily have to be unique. Multiple tracks can drive the same
      property. The result should be based on a weighted blend between the multiple tracks according to
      the weights of their respective actions.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float32Array times]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:Float32Array], converted from the times array which is passed in the constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float32Array values]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:Float32Array], converted from the values array which is passed in the constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Constant DefaultInterpolation]</h3>
    <p>
      The default interpolation type: [page:Animation InterpolateLinear].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:TypedArray TimeBufferType]</h3>
    <p>
      [page:Float32Array], the type of the buffer internally used for the times.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:TypedArray ValueBufferType]</h3>

      parameter passed in the constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Constant getInterpolation]()</h3>
    <p>
      Returns the [page:Animation interpolation type].
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Integer getValueSize]()</h3>

      passed which will receive the results. Otherwise a new array with the appropriate size will be
      created automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creates a new [page:LinearInterpolant LinearInterpolant] from the

      passed which will receive the results. Otherwise a new array with the appropriate size will be
      created automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:this scale]()</h3>
    <p>
      Scales all keyframe times by a factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: This is useful, for example, for conversions to a certain rate of frames per seconds (as it
      is done internally by

    <p>
      This method logs errors to the console, if a track is empty, if the [page:.valueSize value size] is not valid, if an item
      in the [page:.times times] or [page:.values values] array is not a valid number or if the items in the `times` array are out of order.
