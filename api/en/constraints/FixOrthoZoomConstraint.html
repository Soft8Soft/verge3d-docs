    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint makes your ortho camera properly work with objects parented to it, so that they don’t move when the user zooms the camera.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>
