    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint which makes the constrained object move along the curve path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]()</h3>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Constraint] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean bank]</h3>
    <p>
      Enables banking. Banking means the object will lean in towards the center of the curvature of the curve that it travels along, like a motorcycle going around a corner, i.e. it is a kind of roll to left-right. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float bankScale]</h3>
    <p>
      Scales the banking angle. Default is `1`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float bankLimit]</h3>
    <p>
      The maximum allowed absolute banking angle in radians. Default is `Infinity`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Array chordLengths]</h3>
    <p>
      The [page:Array array] of sums of chord lengths. Chord lengths are stored like this:
    </p>
    <p>`[lengthOfChord1, lengthOfChord1 + lengthOfChord2, ...]`</p>
    <p>
      The last element equals to approximated curve length. Note: does not work when [page:.useChordLength useChordLength] is disabled. Default is `[]`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer chordsNum]</h3>
    <p>
      The total chords count on the curve, used when [page:MotionPathConstraint.useChordLength useChordLength] flag is enabled. The bigger the number the more uniformly will be object movement. If `chordsNum <= 0` then it will be computated automatically. Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is `0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Array cvs]</h3>
    <p>
      The packed [page:Array array] of NURBS curve's control points. "Packed" means that the control points stored like this:
    </p>
    <p>`[point_1.x, point_1.y, point_1.z, point_2.x, point_2.y, point_2.z, ...]`</p>
    <p>
      Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is `[]`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer degree]</h3>
    <p>
      The degree of NURBS curve, i.e. the degree of path curve. Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is `3`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean fixCameraLightRotation]</h3>
    <p>
      In Verge3D we use right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing in the up direction, but Blender and 3ds Max uses right-handed coordinate system with Z axis pointing in the up direction (<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/wiki/index.php/Coordinate_Systems" target="_blank">Verge3D Wiki</a>). So, to correct the rotation for cameras and lights, set `fixCameraLightRotation = true`. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float fixedValue]</h3>
    <p>
      Object will stay locked to a single point along the curve regardless of animation. Default is `0.0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean follow]</h3>
    <p>
      If on, computes the object’s orientation (rotation) as it moves along the curve. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String frontAxis]</h3>
    <p>
      The axis of the constrained object that aligns with the front vector, in other words the axis that aligns to the curve tangent. Can be one of the `'X'`, `'-X'`, `'Y'`, `'-Y'`, `'Z'`, `'-Z'`. Default is `'Z'`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float influence]</h3>
    <p>
      The percentage of influence the constraint has on the object. Default is `1.0` (100%).
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isMotionPathConstraint]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are Motion Path constraints. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Array knots]</h3>
    <p>
      The [page:Array array] of NURBS curve knots. Note: it's length always have to be
      `number of control points + degree + 1`. Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is `[]`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer objOffsetMode]</h3>
    <p>
      Set how the offset transformation will be applied to current constraint transformation:<br>
      `0` — the position and rotation transformations will be applied separately (3ds Max behavior).<br>
      `1` — the transformation will be applied as an matrix multiplication (Blender behavior).
      Default is `0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Integer objOffsetRotMode]</h3>
    <p>
      Set how the offset rotation will be applied to current constraint rotation:<br>
      `0` — only constraint rotation will be applied (3ds Max, Maya behavior).<br>
      `1` — the constraint rotation will be applied first, then offset rotation (Blender).
      Default is `0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float offsetValue]</h3>
    <p>
      An additional offset to [page:.value value]. Note: does not work when [page:.useFixedLocation useFixedLocation] is enabled. Default is `0.0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Array pointsTilt]</h3>
    <p>
      The [page:Array array] of tilt angles (bank angles, roll angles) in randians at each curve control point. This is an alternative for [page:.bank bank]. The values are stored like this:
    </p>
    <p>`[tiltAngleForFirstPoint, tiltAngleForSecondPoint, ...]`</p>
    <p>
      Note: does not work when [page:.usePointsTilt usePointsTilt] is disabled. Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is `[]`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String type]</h3>

    <p>
      Enable it to make [page:.value value] cyclic, for example if [page:.value value] = 1.6 then it will be `0.6`, if [page:.value value] = -1.6 it will be `0.4`. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean useFixedLocation]</h3>
    <p>
      Enable it to make object stay locked to a single point along the curve regardless of animation defined by [page:.fixedValue fixedValue]. Default is `false`.
    </p>
