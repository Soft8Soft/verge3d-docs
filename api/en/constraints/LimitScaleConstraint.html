    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint which limits the constrained object's scale in its
      parent's space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]()</h3>
    <p>
      The constructor takes no arguments.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Constraint] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isLimitScaleConstraint]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are limit scale constraints. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 max]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:Vector3] holding the maximum scale values along the corresponding
      axes to limit the constrained object's scale. Default is `(Infinity, Infinity, Infinity)`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 min]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:Vector3] holding the minimum scale values along the corresponding
      axes to limit the constrained object's scale. Default is `(-Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity)`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
    <p>
      The constraint's type. Equals to `'LimitScaleConstraint'`.
    </p>


    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Constraint] class for common methods.</p>


    <h2>Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
      You can use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#limit_transform">limit transform</a> puzzle to apply [name] in a visual manner.
