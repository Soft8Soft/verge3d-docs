    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint which restricts the position of the constrained object
      based on the target's position. Thus the target object behaves like an
      "inivisible wall", "floor", etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Object3D target])</h3>

    <p class="params">[page:Object3D target] — constraint's target object.</p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:String floorLocation]</h3>
    <p>
      The axis to apply the restriction along. Can be one of the `'X'`, `'-X'`, `'Y'`, `'-Y'`, `'Z'`, `'-Z'`.
      Positive means that the constrained object's position along this axis can only be above
      the [page:.offset] value. Negative means - only under the [page:.offset] value. Default is `'Y'`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isFloorConstraint]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are floor constraints. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float offset]</h3>
    <p>
      The limiting value along the [page:.floorLocation] axis. Default is `0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
    <p>
      The constraint's type. Equals to `'FloorConstraint'`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean useRotation]</h3>
    <p>
      When enabled, the constraint takes the target’s rotation into account. This allows you to have a “floor” plane of any orientation you like. Default is `false`.
    </p>
