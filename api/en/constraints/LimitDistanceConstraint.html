    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      A constraint forces its owner to stay either further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
      affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the
      [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Object3D target])</h3>

    <p class="params">[page:Object3D target] — constraint's target object.</p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
    <p>
      The distance from target. Default is `0.0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float influence]</h3>
    <p>
      The percentage of influence the constraint has on the object. Default is `1.0` (100%).
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isLimitDistanceConstraint]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are limit distance constraints. Default is `true`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String limitMode]</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the distance clamping mode. Default is `'LIMITDIST_ONSURFACE'`.
    </p>

    <dl class="params">
      <dt>`'LIMITDIST_INSIDE'`</dt>
      <dd>
        The owner stays further from a given distance from its target.
      </dd>
      <dt>`'LIMITDIST_OUTSIDE'`</dt>
      <dd>
        The owner stays nearer to a given distance from its target.
      </dd>
      <dt>`'LIMITDIST_ONSURFACE'`</dt>
      <dd>
        The owner stays exactly at a given distance from its target.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
    <p>
      The constraint's type. Equals to `'LimitDistanceConstraint'`.
    </p>
