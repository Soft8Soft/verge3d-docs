    <p class="desc">
      Provides utility functions for managing uniform definitions.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <h3>[method:Object clone]([param:Object src])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      src — An object representing uniform definitions.
    </p>
    </p>
      Clones the given uniform definitions by performing a deep-copy. That means if
      the [page:Uniform.value value] of a uniform refers to an object like a [page:Vector3]
      or [page:Texture], the cloned uniform will refer to a new object reference.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Object merge]([param:Array uniforms])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      uniforms — An array of objects containing uniform definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merges the given uniform definitions into a single object. Since the method
      internally uses [page:.clone](), it performs a deep-copy when producing the
      merged uniform definitions.
    </p>
