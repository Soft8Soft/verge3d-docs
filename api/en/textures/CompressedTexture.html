    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      Creates a texture based on data in compressed form, for example from a [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface DDS] file.
    </p>
    <p>
      For use with the [page:CompressedTextureLoader CompressedTextureLoader].

    <h2>Constructor</h2>


    <h3>[name]([param:Array mipmaps], [param:Integer width], [param:Integer height], [param:Constant format], [param:Constant type], [param:Constant mapping], [param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], [param:Constant minFilter], [param:Integer anisotropy], [param:Constant encoding])</h3>
    <p class="params">
    [page:Array mipmaps] — The mipmaps array should contain objects with data, width and height. The mipmaps should be of the correct format and type.<br>

    [page:Integer width] — The width of the biggest mipmap.<br>

    [page:Integer height] — The height of the biggest mipmap.<br>

    [page:Constant format] — The format used in the mipmaps.
    See [page:Textures ST3C Compressed Texture Formats],
    [page:Textures PVRTC Compressed Texture Formats] and
    [page:Textures ETC Compressed Texture Format] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant type] — Default is [page:Textures v3d.UnsignedByteType].
    See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant mapping] —  How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures v3d.UVMapping].
    See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant wrapS] — The default is [page:Textures v3d.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
    See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant wrapT] — The default is [page:Textures v3d.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
    See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant magFilter] — How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
    The default is [page:Textures v3d.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Constant minFilter] — How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
     The default is [page:Textures v3d.LinearMipmapLinearFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br>

    [page:Integer anisotropy] — The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
    By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
    Use renderer.getMaxAnisotropy() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.

    <h3>[property:Boolean flipY]</h3>

    <p>
      False by default. Flipping textures does not work for compressed textures.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean generateMipmaps]</h3>

    <p>
      False by default. Mipmaps can't be generated for compressed textures
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isCompressedTexture]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>
