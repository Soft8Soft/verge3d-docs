    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      Creates a texture for use with a video.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: After the initial use of a texture, the video cannot be changed. Instead, call [page:.dispose]() on the texture and instantiate a new one.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    // assuming you have created a HTML video element with id="video"
    const video = document.getElementById('video');
    const texture = new v3d.VideoTexture(video);
    </code>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:HTMLVideoElement video], [param:Constant mapping], [param:Constant wrapS], [param:Constant wrapT], [param:Constant magFilter], [param:Constant minFilter], [param:Constant format], [param:Constant type], [param:Integer anisotropy])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:Video video] — The video element to use as the texture. <br>

      [page:Constant mapping] —  How the image is applied to the object. An object type of [page:Textures v3d.UVMapping].
      See [page:Textures mapping constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant wrapS] — The default is [page:Textures v3d.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
      See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant wrapT] — The default is [page:Textures v3d.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
      See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant magFilter] — How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
      The default is [page:Textures v3d.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant minFilter] — How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
      The default is [page:Textures v3d.LinearFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant format] — The default is [page:Textures v3d.RGBAFormat].
      See [page:Textures format constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Constant type] — Default is [page:Textures v3d.UnsignedByteType].
      See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br>

      [page:Integer anisotropy] — The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
      By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
      Use [page:WebGLrenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>
      See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean generateMipmaps]</h3>
    <p>
      Whether to generate mipmaps. `false` by default.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isVideoTexture]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      You will not need to set this manually here as it is handled by the [page:VideoTexture.update update]() method.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
      See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common methods.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:undefined update]()</h3>
    <p>
      This is called automatically and sets [page:VideoTexture.needsUpdate .needsUpdate] to `true` every time a new frame is available.
    </p>
