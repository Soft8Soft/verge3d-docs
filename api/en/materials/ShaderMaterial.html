    <p class="desc">
      A material rendered with custom shaders. A shader is a small program written in
      [link:https://www.khronos.org/files/opengles_shading_language.pdf GLSL] that runs on the GPU.
      You may want to use a custom shader if you need to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>implement an effect not included with any of the built-in [page:Material materials]</li>
      <li>combine many objects into a single [page:BufferGeometry] in order to improve performance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There are the following notes to bear in mind when using a `ShaderMaterial`:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A `ShaderMaterial` will only be rendered properly by [page:WebGLRenderer],
        since the GLSL code in the [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader#Vertex_shaders vertexShader]
        and [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader#Pixel_shaders fragmentShader] properties must
        be compiled and run on the GPU using WebGL.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built in attributes and uniforms are passed to the shaders along with your code.
        If you don't want the [page:WebGLProgram] to add anything to your shader code, you can use
        [page:RawShaderMaterial] instead of this class.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use the directive #pragma unroll_loop_start and #pragma unroll_loop_end in order to unroll a `for` loop in GLSL by the shader preprocessor.
        The directive has to be placed right above the loop. The loop formatting has to correspond to a defined standard.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The loop has to be [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_loop normalized].
          </li>
          <!-- Verge3D -->
          <li>
            The loop variable has to be a valid identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            The usage of the loop variable has to be limited to simple indexing, e.g. myVariable[i] or enclosed in braces, e.g. int counter = (i);.
          </li>
          <li>
            The exit condition has to be "<" or "<=".
          </li>
          <li>
            The loop has to use a certain whitespace formatting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nested loops each with its #pragma directive are supported. But GLSL commentaries with uneven curly brackets inside loops will break the unrolling regular expression.
            <code>
#pragma unroll_loop_start
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // ...
}
#pragma unroll_loop_end
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    const material = new v3d.ShaderMaterial({
        uniforms: {
            time: { value: 1.0 },
            resolution: { value: new v3d.Vector2() }
        },
        vertexShader: document.getElementById('vertexShader').textContent,
        fragmentShader: document.getElementById('fragmentShader').textContent
    });
    </code>


    <h2>Vertex shaders and fragment shaders</h2>

    <p>You can specify two different types of shaders for each material:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The vertex shader runs first; it receives <em>attributes</em> calculates / manipulates
        the position of each individual vertex, and passes additional data (<em>varyings</em>) to the fragment shader.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fragment (or pixel) shader runs second; it sets the color of each individual "fragment"
        (pixel) rendered to the screen.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are three types of variables in shaders: uniforms, attributes, and varyings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Uniforms</em> are variables that have the same value for all vertices — lighting, fog,
        and shadow maps are examples of data that would be stored in uniforms.
        Uniforms can be accessed by both the vertex shader and the fragment shader.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Attributes</em> are variables associated with each vertex — for instance, the vertex position,
        face normal, and vertex color are all examples of data that would be stored in attributes.
        Attributes can only be accessed within the vertex shader.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Varyings</em> are variables that are passed from the vertex shader to the fragment shader.
        For each fragment, the value of each varying will be smoothly interpolated from the values of adjacent vertices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that within the shader itself, uniforms and attributes act like constants;
      you can only modify their values by passing different values to the buffers from your JavaScript code.
    </p>


    <h2>Built-in attributes and uniforms</h2>

    <p>
      The [page:WebGLRenderer] provides many attributes and uniforms to shaders by default;
      definitions of these variables are prepended to your `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`
      code by the [page:WebGLProgram] when the shader is compiled; you don't need to declare them yourself.
      See [page:WebGLProgram] for details of these variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these uniforms or attributes (e.g. those pertaining lighting, fog, etc.)
      require properties to be set on the material in order for [page:WebGLRenderer] to copy
      the appropriate values to the GPU—make sure to set these flags if you want to use these
      features in your own shader.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't want [page:WebGLProgram] to add anything to your shader code, you can use
      [page:RawShaderMaterial] instead of this class.
    </p>


    <h2>Custom attributes and uniforms</h2>

    <p>
      Both custom attributes and uniforms must be declared in your GLSL shader code
      (within `vertexShader` and/or `fragmentShader`). Custom uniforms must be defined in `both`
      the `uniforms` property of your `ShaderMaterial`, whereas any custom attributes must be
      defined via [page:BufferAttribute] instances. Note that `varying`s only need to
      be declared within the shader code (not within the material).
    </p>
    <p>
      To declare a custom attribute, please reference the [page:BufferGeometry] page for an overview,
      and the [page:BufferAttribute] page for a detailed look at the `BufferAttribute` API.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating your attributes, each typed array that you create to hold your
      attribute's data must be a multiple of your data type's size. For example, if your
      attribute is a [page:Vector3 v3d.Vector3] type, and you have 3000 vertices in your
      [page:BufferGeometry], your typed array value must be created with a length of 3000 * 3,
      or 9000 (one value per-component). A table of each data type's size is shown below for reference:
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption><a id="attribute-sizes">Attribute sizes</a></caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>GLSL type</th>
          <th>JavaScript type</th>
          <th>Size</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>float</td>
          <td>[page:Float]</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>vec2</td>
          <td>[page:Vector2 v3d.Vector2]</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>vec3</td>
          <td>[page:Vector3 v3d.Vector3]</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>vec3</td>
          <td>[page:Color v3d.Color]</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>vec4</td>
          <td>[page:Vector4 v3d.Vector4]</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that attribute buffers are `not` refreshed automatically when their values change. To update custom attributes,
      set the `needsUpdate` flag to true on the [page:BufferAttribute] of the geometry (see [page:BufferGeometry]
      for further details).
    </p>

    <p>
      To declare a custom [page:Uniform], use the `uniforms` property:
    </p>

    <code>
    uniforms: {
        time: { value: 1.0 },
        resolution: { value: new v3d.Vector2() }
    }
    </code>

    <p>
      You're recommended to update custom [page:Uniform] values depending on [page:Object3D object] and [page:Camera camera]
      in [page:Object3D.onBeforeRender] because [page:Material] can be shared among [page:Mesh meshes], [page:Matrix4 matrixWorld]
      of [page:Scene] and [page:Camera] are updated in [page:WebGLRenderer.render], and some effects render a [page:Scene scene]
      with their own private [page:Camera cameras].
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Object parameters])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:Object parameters] — (optional) an object with one or more properties defining the material's appearance.
      Any property of the material (including any property inherited from [page:Material]) can be passed in here.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Material] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean clipping]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines whether this material supports clipping; true to let the renderer pass the clippingPlanes uniform. Default is false.
    </p>

    <!-- Verge3D -->
    <h3>[property:Object customPrepTokens]</h3>
    <p>
      Custom preprocessing tokens — an object analogous to the [page:.defines] property, but
      instead of adding a #define directive for every key/value pair they are manually
      replaced in the GLSL code before shader compilation. Used for the #pragma unroll_loop
      directive to define the loop initializer and the condition values the same way as
      with a #define directive, but since unrolling is performed prior to compilation
      these values also have to be known afore, that's why this property is a distinct
      container for such values:
    </p>

    <code>
    customPrepTokens: {
        MAX_SIZE: 10
    }
    </code>

    <p>makes the following code:</p>

    <code>
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_SIZE; i++) {
        // ...
    }
    </code>

    <p>to be this before compilation:</p>

    <code>
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        // ...
    }
    </code>

    <h3>[property:Object defaultAttributeValues]</h3>
    <p>
      When the rendered geometry doesn't include these attributes but the material does, these default values will be passed to the shaders. This avoids errors when buffer data is missing.
    </p>

    <code>
    this.defaultAttributeValues = {
        'color': [1, 1, 1],
        'uv': [0, 0],
        'uv2': [0, 0]
    };
    </code>


    <h3>[property:Object defines]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines custom constants using `#define` directives within the GLSL code for both the
      vertex shader and the fragment shader; each key/value pair yields another directive:
    </p>

    <code>
    defines: {
        FOO: 15,
        BAR: true
    }
    </code>

    <p>yields the lines</p>

    <code>
    #define FOO 15
    #define BAR true
    </code>

    <p>in the GLSL code.</p>

    <h3>[property:Object extensions]</h3>
    <p>
      An object with the following properties:
    </p>

    <code>
    this.extensions = {
        derivatives: false, // set to use derivatives
        fragDepth: false, // set to use fragment depth values
        drawBuffers: false, // set to use draw buffers
        shaderTextureLOD: false // set to use shader texture LOD
    };
    </code>


    <h3>[property:Boolean fog]</h3>
    <p>
      Define whether the material color is affected by global fog settings; true to pass
      fog uniforms to the shader. Default is false.
    </p>


    <h3>[property:String fragmentShader]</h3>
    <p>
      Fragment shader GLSL code.  This is the actual code for the shader. In the example above,
      the `vertexShader` and `fragmentShader` code is extracted from the DOM; it could be passed
      as a string directly or loaded via AJAX instead.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String glslVersion]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the GLSL version of custom shader code. Only relevant for WebGL 2 in order to define whether to specify
      GLSL 3.0 or not. Valid values are `v3d.GLSL1` or `v3d.GLSL3`. Default is `null`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String index0AttributeName]</h3>
    <p>
      If set, this calls [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/bindAttribLocation gl.bindAttribLocation]
      to bind a generic vertex index to an attribute variable.
      Default is undefined.

    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isShaderMaterial]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean lights]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines whether this material uses lighting; true to pass uniform data related to lighting to this shader. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float linewidth]</h3>
    <p>Controls wireframe thickness. Default is `1`.</p>

    <p>
      Due to limitations of the [link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf OpenGL Core Profile]
      with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer on most platforms linewidth will
      always be 1 regardless of the set value.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean flatShading]</h3>
    <p>
      Define whether the material is rendered with flat shading. Default is false.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Object uniforms]</h3>
    <p>
      An object of the form:
      <code>
      { "uniform1": { value: 1.0 }, "uniform2": { value: 2 } }
      </code>
      specifying the uniforms to be passed to the shader code; keys are uniform names, values are definitions of the form
      <code>
      { value: 1.0 }
      </code>
      where `value` is the value of the uniform. Names must match the name of the uniform,
      as defined in the GLSL code. Note that uniforms are refreshed on every frame,
      so updating the value of the uniform will immediately update the value available to the GLSL code.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean uniformsNeedUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      Can be used to force a uniform update while changing uniforms in [page:Object3D.onBeforeRender](). Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean vertexColors]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines whether vertex coloring is used. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:String vertexShader]</h3>
    <p>
      Vertex shader GLSL code.  This is the actual code for the shader. In the example above,
      the `vertexShader` and `fragmentShader` code is extracted from the DOM; it could be passed
      as a string directly or loaded via AJAX instead.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean wireframe]</h3>
    <p>
      Render geometry as wireframe (using GL_LINES instead of GL_TRIANGLES). Default is `false` (i.e. render as flat polygons).
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float wireframeLinewidth]</h3>
    <p>
      Controls wireframe thickness. Default is `1`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to limitations of the [link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf OpenGL Core Profile]
      with the [page:WebGLRenderer WebGL] renderer on most platforms linewidth will
      always be `1` regardless of the set value.
    </p>


    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Material] class for common methods.</p>

    <h3>[method:ShaderMaterial copy]([param:ShaderMaterial source])</h3>
    <p>
      Generates a shallow copy of this material. Note that the vertexShader and fragmentShader
      are copied <em>by reference</em>, as are the definitions of the <em>attributes</em>; this means
      that clones of the material will share the same compiled [page:WebGLProgram]. However, the
      uniforms are copied <em>by value</em>, which allows you to have different sets of uniforms
      for different copies of the material.
    </p>
