    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      Represents an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) in 3D space.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    const box = new v3d.Box3();

    const mesh = new v3d.Mesh(
        new v3d.SphereGeometry(),
        new v3d.MeshBasicMaterial()
    );

    // ensure the bounding box is computed for its geometry
    // this should be done only once (assuming static geometries)
    mesh.geometry.computeBoundingBox();

    // ...

    // in the animation loop, compute the current bounding box with the world matrix
    box.copy(mesh.geometry.boundingBox).applyMatrix4(mesh.matrixWorld);
