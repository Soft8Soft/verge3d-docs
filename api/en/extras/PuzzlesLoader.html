    <p>
      Load the Puzzles editor and the logic file. The method needs to be provided with the path to the Puzzles Editor's source folder (specified by the `editorDir` parameter, usually it's the <em>puzzles</em> subfolder of the Verge3D installation folder) and with the path to the logic JS file (`logicURL` parameter). The `onLoad` callback can be used to load a scene after the editor and the logic file were loaded.

    <p>
      Load the logic file. The `onLoad` callback can be used to load a scene after the logic file was loaded.
