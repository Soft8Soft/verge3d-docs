    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      Abstract base class for cameras. This class should always be inherited when you build a new camera.
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]()</h3>
    <p>
      Creates a new [name]. Note that this class is not intended to be called directly; you probably want a [page:PerspectiveCamera] or [page:OrthographicCamera] instead.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>
      See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:ControlSettings controlSettings]</h3>
    <p>
      Camera control settings used to assign application [page:App.controls controls].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean ignoreShadowLayers]</h3>
    <p>
      Ignore camera layers when rendering objects into the shadow map. Used internally by SSR pass. Default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isCamera]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
    <p>
      The [page:Layers layers] that the camera is a member of. This is an inherited property from [page:Object3D].
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects must share at least one layer with the camera to be seen by the camera.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorldInverse]</h3>
    <p>
      This is the inverse of `matrixWorld`. `matrixWorld` contains the matrix which has the world transform of the camera.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrix]</h3>
    <p>
      This is the matrix which contains the projection.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrixInverse]</h3>
    <p>
      The inverse of `projectionMatrix`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Object viewportFit]</h3>

    <p>
      An object with viewport fit settings:
    </p>

    <dl class="params">
      <dt>[page:Cameras type]</dt>
      <dd>Viewport fit type, see [page:Cameras here] for more info.</dd>
      <dt>[page:Float initialAspect]</dt>
      <dd>Initial viewport aspect ratio.</dd>
    </dl>


    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
      See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Camera clone]([param:Boolean recursive])</h3>
    <p>
      Return a new camera with the same properties as this one.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:this copy]([param:Camera source], [param:Boolean recursive])</h3>
    <p>
      Copy the properties from the source camera into this one.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Vector3 getWorldDirection]([param:Vector3 target])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:Vector3 target] â€” the result will be copied into this vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns a [page:Vector3] representing the world space direction in which the camera is looking. Note: A camera looks down its local, negative Z-axis.
    </p>


    <h2>Puzzles</h2>
    <p>
      There are numerous <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Camera.html">camera puzzles</a> to manage your camera with no coding.
