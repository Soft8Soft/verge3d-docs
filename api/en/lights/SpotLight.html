    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      This light gets emitted from a single point in one direction, along a cone that increases in size
      the further from the light it gets.
    </p>

    <p>
      This light can cast shadows — see the [page:SpotLightShadow] page for details.
    </p>

    <h2>Target and Free Spot Lights</h2>
    <p>
      In Verge3D, spot lights can operate in two different modes depending on the value of the [page:.isFreeLight] flag. If `isFreeLight=true` [name] is the equivalent to what is often called a "Target Spotlight" in 3ds Max. When `isFreeLight=true` the light is equivalent to "Free Spotlight" in 3ds Max or just "Spot Light" in Blender/Maya.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, the light direction is calculated as pointing from the light's [page:Object3D.position position] to the [page:.target target]'s position. In the first mode, `target` is specified explicitly, while in the second mode, `target` is calculated by the engine from the light object [page:Object3D.quaternion rotation].
    </p>

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <code>
    // white spotlight shining from the side, modulated by a texture, casting a shadow
    const spotLight = new v3d.SpotLight(0xffffff);
    spotLight.position.set(100, 1000, 100);
    spotLight.map = new v3d.TextureLoader().load(url);

    spotLight.castShadow = true;

    spotLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
    spotLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;

    spotLight.shadow.camera.near = 500;
    spotLight.shadow.camera.far = 4000;
    spotLight.shadow.camera.fov = 30;

    scene.add(spotLight);
    </code>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity], [param:Float distance], [param:Radians angle], [param:Float penumbra], [param:Float decay])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:Integer color] — (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br>
      [page:Float intensity] — (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br>
      [page:Float distance] — Maximum range of the light. Default is 0 (no limit).<br>
      [page:Radians angle] — Maximum angle of light dispersion from its direction whose upper
      bound is Math.PI/2.<br>
      [page:Float penumbra] — Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra.
      Takes values between zero and 1. Default is zero.<br>
      [page:Float decay] — The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creates a new [name].
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.</p>

    <h3>[property:Float angle]</h3>
    <p>
      Maximum extent of the spotlight, in radians, from its direction. Should be no more than
      `Math.PI/2`. The default is `Math.PI/3`.
    </p>


    <h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
    <p>
      If set to `true` light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and
      requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [page:SpotLightShadow] for details.
      The default is `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
    <p>
      The amount the light dims along the distance of the light. Default is `2`.<br>
      In context of physically-correct rendering the default value should not be changed.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
    <p>
      When distance is zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law to infinite distance. When distance is non-zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law until near the distance cutoff, where it will then attenuate quickly and smoothly to `0`. Inherently, cutoffs are not physically correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default is `0.0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float intensity]</h3>
    <p>
      The light's intensity. Default is `1`. Intensity is the luminous intensity of the light measured in candela (cd).
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing the intensity will also change the light's power.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isFreeLight]</h3>
    <p>
      Flag which used to define the lights with no explicit target. For such lights the virtual `target` is calculated from the [page:Object3D.quaternion rotation] applied to the light object.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isSpotLight]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float penumbra]</h3>
    <p>
      Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra. Takes values between
      zero and 1. The default is `0.0`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
    <p>
      This is set equal to [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] `(0, 1, 0)`, so that the light shines from the top down.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
    <p>
      The light's power. Power is the luminous power of the light measured in lumens (lm).
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing the power will also change the light's intensity.
    </p>


    <h3>[property:SpotLightShadow shadow]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:SpotLightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.
    </p>


    <h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
    <p>
      The Spotlight points from its [page:.position position] to target.position. The default
      position of the target is `(0, 0, 0)`.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default, it must be added to the [page:Scene scene] using
    </p>

    <code>
    scene.add(light.target);
    </code>

    <p>
      This is so that the target's [page:Object3D.matrixWorld matrixWorld] gets automatically updated each frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      If `isFreeLight=false` is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a
      [page:Object3D.position position] property), like so:
    </p>

    <code>
    const targetObject = new v3d.Object3D();
    scene.add(targetObject);

    light.target = targetObject;
    </code>

    <p>
      The spotlight will now track the target object.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
    <p>
      A [page:Texture] used to modulate the color of the light. The spot light color is mixed
      with the RGB value of this texture, with a ratio corresponding to its
      alpha value. The cookie-like masking effect is reproduced using pixel values (0, 0, 0, 1-cookie_value).
      *Warning*: [page:.map] is disabled if [page:.castShadow] is `false`.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.</p>

    <h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
    <p>
      Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:this copy]([param:SpotLight source])</h3>
    <p>
      Copies value of all the properties from the [page:SpotLight source] to this SpotLight.
    </p>
