    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      This is used internally by [page:DirectionalLightShadowCSM DirectionalLightShadowCSM] for calculating shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the other shadow classes, this uses an [page:OrthographicCamera] to calculate the shadows,
      rather than a [page:PerspectiveCamera]. This is because light rays from a [page:DirectionalLight]
      are parallel.
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>
    <h3>[name]()</h3>
    <p>
      Creates a new [name]. This is not intended to be called directly â€” it is called
      internally by [page:DirectionalLightShadowCSM].
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>
      See the base [page:LightShadow LightShadow] class for common properties.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
    <p>
      The light's view of the world. This is used to generate a depth map of the scene; objects behind
      other objects from the light's perspective will be in shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default is an [page:OrthographicCamera] with [page:OrthographicCamera.left left] and
      [page:OrthographicCamera.bottom bottom] set to -5,  [page:OrthographicCamera.right right]
      and [page:OrthographicCamera.top top] set to 5, the [page:OrthographicCamera.near near]
      clipping plane at 0.5 and the [page:OrthographicCamera.far far] clipping plane at 500.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isDirectionalLightShadowCascade]</h3>
    <p>
      Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean pancakeDepth]</h3>
    <p>
      When enabled, clamps the depth of occluder objects outside the shadow frustum along the Z axis in shadow camera view space,
      i.e. pancakes to shadow camera near plane. The default is `true`.
    </p>
