    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      Serves as a base class for the other shadow classes.
    </p>


    <h2>Constructor</h2>

    <h3>[name]([param:Camera camera])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      [page:Camera camera] — the light's view of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new [name]. This is not intended to be called directly — it is used as a base class by other light shadows.
    </p>


    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <h3>[property:Boolean autoUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      Enables automatic updates of the light's shadow. Default is `true`.  If you do not require dynamic lighting / shadows, you may set this to `false`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float bias]</h3>
    <p>
      Shadow map bias, how much to add or subtract from the normalized depth when deciding whether a surface is in shadow. The default is `0`. Very tiny adjustments here (in the order of 0.0001) may help reduce artifacts in shadows
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
    <p>
      The light's view of the world. This is used to generate a depth map of the scene; objects behind other objects from the light's perspective will be in shadow.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float expBias]</h3>
    <p>
      Exponential bias for [page:Renderer ESMShadowMap] to reduce light leaking which can happen near an occluder. The default is `1`. Increasing it reduces light leaking but make shadows less soft and make self-shadowing artifacts a bit more noticeable.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean isLightShadow]</h3>
    <p>
      Used to check whether this or derived classes are light shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not change this, as it used internally for optimization.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget map]</h3>
    <p>
      The depth map generated using the internal camera; a location beyond a pixel's depth is in shadow. Computed internally during rendering.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget mapPass]</h3>
    <p>
      The distribution map generated using the internal camera; an occlusion is calculated based on the distribution of depths. Computed internally during rendering.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Vector2 mapSize]</h3>
    <p>
      A [Page:Vector2] defining the width and height of the shadow map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation time. Values must be powers of 2, up to the [page:WebGLRenderer.capabilities].maxTextureSize for a given device, although the width and height don't have to be the same (so, for example, `(512, 1024)` is valid). The default is `(512, 512)`.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
    <p>
      Model to shadow camera space, to compute location and depth in shadow map. Stored in a [page:Matrix4 Matrix4]. This is computed internally during rendering.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
    <p>
      When set to `true`, shadow maps will be updated in the next render call. Default is `false`. If you have set [page:.autoUpdate] to `false`, you will need to set this property to `true` and then make a render call to update the light's shadow.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float normalBias]</h3>
    <p>
      Defines how much the position used to query the shadow map is offset along the object normal. The default is `0`. Increasing this value can be used to reduce shadow acne especially in large scenes where light shines onto geometry at a shallow angle. The cost is that shadows may appear distorted.
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float radius]</h3>
    <p>
      Setting this to values greater than 1 will blur the edges of the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      High values will cause unwanted banding effects in the shadows — a greater [page:.mapSize mapSize] will allow for a higher value to be used here before these effects become visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this has no effect if the [page:WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type] is set to [page:Renderer BasicShadowMap] or [page:Renderer BilinearShadowMap].
    </p>

    <h3>[property:Float slopeScaledBias]</h3>
    <p>
      An adaptive bias which depends on the polygon's slope relative to the light's camera. Default is `0`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Used mainly for shadow mapping.
    </p>


    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <h3>[method:LightShadow clone]()</h3>
    <p>
      Creates a new LightShadow with the same properties as this one.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:this copy]([param:LightShadow source])</h3>
    <p>
      Copies value of all the properties from the [page:LightShadow source] to this Light.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
    <p>
      Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Vector2 getFrameExtents]()</h3>
    <p>
      Used internally by the renderer to extend the shadow map to contain all viewports
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Frustum getFrustum]()</h3>
    <p>
      Gets the shadow cameras frustum. Used internally by the renderer to cull objects.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Integer getViewportCount]()</h3>
    <p>
      Used internally by the renderer to get the number of viewports that need to be rendered for this shadow.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:undefined updateMatrices]([param:Light light])</h3>
    <p class="params">
      light — the light for which the shadow is being rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Update the matrices for the camera and shadow, used internally by the renderer.
    </p>
