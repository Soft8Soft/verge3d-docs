    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      This is used internally by [page:ReactAreaLight ReactAreaLights] for calculating shadows.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Similarly to point light shadows, rectangular light shadows require up to 6 times more draw calls compared to directional or spot light shadows. They also consume more GPU memory. So you better use them only if it's absolutely necessary.
